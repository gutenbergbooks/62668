<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Autobiography</span> is open to the charge of egoism; somewhat unjustly since,
in writing of oneself, the personal note must predominate and, in the
case of a genius&mdash;sure of his goal and of his power to reach it&mdash;faith
in himself amounts to what, in a smaller man, would be mere conceit.</p>

<p>This must be condoned and discounted for the sake of the priceless gift
of insight into a personality of exceptional interest.</p>

<p>Berlioz’ Memoir, graphic as it is, cannot be called satisfactory as a
character-study. He says plainly that he is not writing confessions, but
is simply giving a correct account of his life to silence the many false
versions current at the time. Therefore, while describing almost too
minutely some of his difficulties and most of his conflicts&mdash;whereby he
gives the impression of living in uncomfortably hot water&mdash;his very real
heroism comes out only in his Letters, and then quite unconsciously.</p>

<p>The Memoir and Letters combined, however, make up an interesting and
fascinating picture of the heights, depths, limitations and curious
inconsistencies of this weird and restless human being.</p>

<p>The music-ridden, brutal, undisciplined creature of the
Autobiography&mdash;more a blind, unreasoning force of Nature than an
ordinary being, subject to the restrictions of common humanity&mdash;could
not possibly be the man who was rich in the unswerving affection of such
widely different characters as Heine, Liszt, Ernst, Alexandre, Heller,
Hiller, Jules Janin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_x" id="page_x">{x}</a></span> Dumas and Bertin; there must be something
unchronicled to account for their loyalty and patience. This something
is revealed in the Letters.</p>

<p>There stands the real Berlioz&mdash;musician and poet; eager to drain life to
the dregs, be they sweet or bitter, to taste the fulness of being. There
we find a faithful record of thoughts, feelings, aspirations, and a
reflection of every passing mood. With one notable exception: even to
Ferrand he never admitted that the poor reception of <i>The Trojans</i> (for
it met with but a <i>succès d’estime</i>) broke his heart.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a record of events the Autobiography is deficient, and after 1848
becomes a mere sketch. Thus, while writing pages of description of
orchestral players and musical institutions in German and Austrian
cities&mdash;quite suitable to his newspaper articles, but wearisome in their
iteration, and throwing no light upon himself&mdash;he is almost entirely
silent on his later trips to London. And the visits to Baden&mdash;brightest
days of his later years&mdash;are dismissed in a footnote.</p>

<p>He lingers pathetically over young days, and hurries through the dreary
time close at hand. So, for a record of the daily conflict with physical
pain; of the overshadowed domestic life&mdash;none the easier to bear in that
it was partly his own fault; of the grinding, ever-present shortness of
money; of his wild and beautiful dreams; and of the large place that
Ferrand, Morel, Massart, Damcke and Lwoff (many of whom are not named in
the memoir) held in his heart&mdash;we turn to the Letters.</p>

<p>The fearless, unbroken affection for his Jonathan&mdash;Humbert Ferrand; the
passionate love for his only son, mingled with impatience at Louis’
youthful instability; the whole-hearted ungrudging appreciation he
extended to young and honest<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xi" id="page_xi">{xi}</a></span> musicians&mdash;particularly to Camille
Saint-Saëns&mdash;are a grateful contrast to the gloomy defiance,
tornado-like fury, and eternal jeremiads over the hypocrisy and
hollowness of Paris that mar the Memoir.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of his ill-starred first marriage he says but little, either in Memoir
or Letters.</p>

<p>He and Miss Smithson were far too highly-strung for peaceful life to be
possible, even without the added friction of ill-health, want of money
(which, however, he says never daunted her), and the probable
misunderstandings so likely to arise from their different nationalities.</p>

<p>It may be due to his special form of artistic temperament&mdash;that
well-worn apology for everything <i>déréglé</i>&mdash;that he could find room in
his heart, or head, for more than one love at a time, and could even
analyse and classify each.</p>

<p>Within a month he bounds from the nethermost despair over the
uncertainties of his English divinity to the highest rapture over his
Camille, his Ariel, as he calls Marie Pleyel.</p>

<p>Later on, when Marie is safely disposed of and Henriette is again in the
ascendant, while she vacillates between family and lover, he seriously
contemplates running off to Berlin with a poor girl whom he has
befriended, and whom, when Henriette finally relents, he calmly hands
over to Jules Janin to provide for.</p>

<p>Of his second wife we hear but little, except that even affection did
not blind him to the defects in her musical gifts. For, on his first
German tour, he wrote to Morel:</p>

<p>“Pity me! Marie wished to sing at Stuttgart, Mannheim and Hechingen. The
two first were bearable, but the last!... Yet she would not hear of my
engaging another singer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xii" id="page_xii">{xii}</a></span>”</p>

<p>Then he incidentally and whimsically mentions an innocent embryo
love-affair in Russia, and, in 1863, makes such tragic and mysterious
reference to an impossible love, that Ferrand, seriously alarmed, thinks
that Louis must have become more than usually troublesome.</p>

<p>The influence of Estelle Fournier, which pervaded his whole life, comes
under a different category. He was without religion; she supplied its
place. She was his dream-lady, the Beatrice to his Dante, that necessary
worship which no great soul can forego. The proof of this is that, when
he met her again&mdash;old, sweet, dignified and still beautiful to him&mdash;his
allegiance never wavered; she was still the Mountain Star of his
childhood’s days.</p>

<p>If his capacity for love was unlimited, it was not so with his sense of
humour, which was curiously circumscribed. Occasionally he rivals Heine
in power of seeing the odd side of his own divagations; his account of
his headlong flight from Rome to murder the whole erring Moke family is
inimitable. Yet he never discovers&mdash;as a man with a true sense of humour
would have done&mdash;that, in sharpening his rapier on Wagner and the Music
of the Future, he is meting out to a struggling composer precisely the
same measure that the Parisians had meted out to himself. It speaks
volumes for the strength of his friendship with Liszt that even
Wagnerism could not divide them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>La Côte Saint-André is a large village some thirty odd miles from
Grenoble; here, in a handsome house in the Rue de la République, Louis
Hector Berlioz was born. His home education and seclusion from healthy
school-life and the society of other children of his age ill-fitted him
for the battle of life, which began with his medical student career in
Paris.</p>

<p>He describes the quarrels with his parents and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xiii" id="page_xiii">{xiii}</a></span> stoppage of his
allowance in 1826, but passes lightly over the privations and
semi-starvation that undoubtedly laid the foundations of that internal
disease which embittered his latter years. His graphic account of those
early Parisian days is one of the most interesting parts of the Memoir.
He declared that his time in Italy, after gaining the Prix de Rome, was
musically barren. Yet this must be a mistake, since, to the memory of
his mountain wanderings he owed the inspiration of <i>Harold</i>. And even if
he apparently gained nothing in music, the experience of what to avoid
and the influence of beautiful scenery&mdash;to which he was always
peculiarly sensitive&mdash;counted for much in his general development.</p>

<p>With his return to Paris his character took form, and he began his
life-long warfare against shams and empiricism. Newspaper work, hated as
it was, had a great share in moulding him. Each year he grew more
autocratic, and each year more hated for his uncompromising
sledge-hammer speech. But Ferrand was correct in saying that he could
write. His style is clear, incisive, perfect and even elegant French,
although, naturally, owing to the exigencies of its production, it is
often unequal. The first years of his marriage were ideal in spite of
their penury. The young couple had a côterie of choice friends, amongst
whom Liszt took a foremost place, but gradually the clouds gathered, the
rift within the lute widened, until a separation became inevitable; even
then Berlioz does not attempt&mdash;as so many men of his impatient spirit
might have done&mdash;to shirk responsibility and throw upon others the
burden of his hostage to fortune&mdash;an unsympathetic invalid&mdash;but works
the harder at his literary tread-mill to provide her indispensable
comforts. Poor Henriette’s side of the story is untold, and one can but
say:</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem">“The pity of it!”</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xiv" id="page_xiv">{xiv}</a></span></p>

<p>His troubles in Paris and the triumphs abroad that were their antidote
made up the rest of his stormy, restless pilgrimage; yet even in
ungrateful Paris he was not entirely neglected.</p>

<p>He received the Legion of Honour, and although professing to despise it,
he always wore the ribbon. He was also chosen one of the Immortals,
apropos of which M. Alexandre tells a funny story.</p>

<p>Alexandre was canvassing for him and found great difficulty in managing
Adolph Adam, who was from Berlioz as the poles asunder.</p>

<p>First he went to Berlioz, who had flatly refused to make the slightest
concession to Adam’s prejudices.</p>

<p>“Come,” said he, “do at least be amiable to Adam; you cannot deny that
he is a musician, at any rate.”</p>

<p>“I don’t say he is not; but, being a great musician, how can he lower
himself to comic-opera? If he chose he could <i>write such music as I
do</i>.”</p>

<p>Undismayed, Alexandre went to Adam.</p>

<p>“You will give your vote to Berlioz, will you not, dear friend? Although
you cannot appreciate each other, you will own that he is a thorough
musician.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, he is a great musician, a really great one, but his music is
awfully tiresome. Why!”&mdash;and little Adam straightened his
spectacles&mdash;“why, if he chose he could compose ... as well as I do. But,
seriously, he is a man of some importance, and I promise that, after
Clapisson, who already has our votes, Berlioz shall have the next
vacancy.”</p>

<p>By a strange coincidence, the next <i>fauteuil</i> was Adam’s own, to which
Berlioz was elected by nineteen votes.</p>

<p>In his weak state of health, Berlioz was quite unfit to face the
innumerable worries incidental to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xv" id="page_xv">{xv}</a></span> the production of <i>The Trojans</i>. For
seven years it had been his chief object in life, and if, as he said, he
could have had everything requisite at his command, with unlimited
capital to draw upon&mdash;as Wagner had with Louis of Bavaria&mdash;all might
have been well. But to fight, contrive, temporise and propitiate all at
once was more than his enfeebled frame and irascible spirit could stand.</p>

<p>Hence his great injustice to Carvalho, who, for Art’s sake, sacrificed
money, time and reputation to an extent that crippled him for many
years.</p>

<p>Embittered by the failure of his opera, which ran for about twenty-five
nights, he shut himself up in his rooms with Madame Recio, his devoted
mother-in-law, and an old servant, and from that time visited only a few
intimate friends.</p>

<p>One last shock Fate held in store. Louis died of fever abroad, and for
his lonely father life had no more savour&mdash;he simply existed, with,
however, two last flashes of the old bright flame. One when, at
Herbeck’s desire, he went to Vienna to conduct the <i>Damnation de Faust</i>,
and the other when the Grand Duchess Helen prevailed on him to visit St
Petersburg again.</p>

<p>That was the real end.</p>

<p>On leaving Russia he wandered drearily to Nice&mdash;a ghost revisiting its
old-time haunts&mdash;then made one last appearance at Grenoble, and so the
flame went out. He who had never peace in life was at rest at last.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of his music this is not the place to speak. He has fully described his
own ideas, others have analysed them, and we are now concerned with the
man himself.</p>

<p>To this is due the somewhat disjointed form of the translation&mdash;the
mixture of Memoir and Letters. It seemed the only possible way of
showing Berlioz<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xvi" id="page_xvi">{xvi}</a></span> in all his aspects and of keeping the record
chronologically correct.</p>

<p>Yet we could wish that he, who had so much affinity with England and its
literature, could meet with due appreciation here.</p>

<p>He has founded no school (in spite of Krebs’ prophecy), unless the
“programme music” now so much in vogue can be traced back to him, but,
beginning with Wagner, every orchestral composer since his day owes him
a debt of gratitude for his discoveries&mdash;his daring and original
combinations of instruments, and his magnificent grouping and handling
of vast bodies of executants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xvii" id="page_xvii">{xvii}</a></span></p>

<p class="c">THE LIFE OF BERLIOZ</p>

<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I<br /><br />
<small>LA CÔTE SAINT-ANDRÉ</small></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Decidedly</span> ours is a prosaic century. On no other grounds can my wounded
vanity account for the humiliating fact that no auspicious omens, no
mighty portents&mdash;such as heralded the birth of the great men of the
golden age of poetry&mdash;gave notice of my coming. It is strange, but true,
that I was born, quite unobtrusively, at La Côte Saint-André, between
Vienne and Grenoble, on the 11th December 1803.</p>

<p>As its name implies, La Côte Saint-André lies on a hillside overlooking
a plain&mdash;wide, green, and golden&mdash;of which the dreamy majesty is
accentuated by the mountain belt that bounds it on the southeast, being
in turn crowned by the mystic glory of distant Alpine glaciers and snowy
peaks.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I was brought up in the Catholic faith. This&mdash;of all
religions the most charming, since it gave up burning people&mdash;was for
seven years the joy of my life, and although we have since fallen out, I
still retain my tender memories of it.</p>

<p>Indeed, so greatly am I in sympathy with its creed that, had I had the
misfortune to be born in the clutches of one of the dreary schisms
hatched by Luther and Calvin, I should certainly, at the first awakening
of my poetic instinct, have thrown off its benumbing grasp and have
flung myself into the arms of the fair Roman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_2" id="page_2">{2}</a></span></p>

<p>My sweet remembrance of my first communion is probably due to my having
made it with my elder sister at the Ursuline convent, where she was a
boarder.</p>

<p>At early morn, accompanied by the almoner, I made my way to that holy
house. The soft spring sunlight, the murmuring poplars swaying in the
whispering breeze, the dainty fragrance of the morning air, all worked
upon my sensitive mind, until, as I knelt among those fair white
maidens, and heard their fresh young voices raised in the eucharistic
hymn, my whole soul was filled with mystic passion. Heaven opened before
me&mdash;a heaven of love and pure delight, a thousand times more glorious
than tongue has told&mdash;and thus I gave myself to God.</p>

<p>Such is the marvellous power of genuine melody, of heart-felt
expression! Ten years later I recognised that air&mdash;so innocently adapted
to a religious ceremony&mdash;as “When my beloved shall return,” from
d’Aleyrac’s opera <i>Nina</i>.</p>

<p>Dear, dead d’Aleyrac! Even your name is forgotten now!</p>

<p>This was my musical awakening.</p>

<p>Thus abruptly I became a saint, and such a desperate saint! Every day I
went to mass, every Sunday I took the communion, every week I went to
confession in order to say to my director:</p>

<p>“Father, I have done nothing.”</p>

<p>“Well, my son,” would the worthy man reply, “continue.”</p>

<p>I followed his advice strictly for many years.</p>

<p>Louis Berlioz, my father, was a doctor. It is not my place to sing his
praises. I need, therefore, only say that he was looked upon as an
honoured friend, not only in our little town, but throughout the whole
country side. Feeling acutely his responsibility as the steward of a
difficult and dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_3" id="page_3">{3}</a></span> profession, every minute he could spare from
his sick people was given to arduous study, and never did the thought of
gain turn him aside from his disinterested service to the poor and
needy.</p>

<p>In 1810, the medical society of Montpellier offered a prize for the best
treatise on a new and important point in medicine, which was gained by
my father’s monograph on Chronic Diseases. It was printed in Paris, and
many of its theories adopted by physicians, who had not the common
honesty to acknowledge their source. This somewhat surprised my dear,
unsophisticated father, but he only said, “If truth prevails, nothing
else matters.”</p>

<p>Now (I write in 1848) he has long since ceased to practise, and spends
his time in reading and peaceful thought.</p>

<p>Of the highest type of liberal mind, he is entirely without social,
political, or religious prejudices; for instance, having promised my
mother to leave my faith undisturbed, I have known him carry his
tolerance so far as to hear me my catechism. This is considerably more,
I must own, than I could do were my own son in question.</p>

<p>For many years my father has suffered from an incurable disease of the
stomach. He scarcely eats at all, and nothing but constant and
increasing doses of opium keep him alive. He has told me that, years
ago, worn out by the prolonged agony, he took thirty-two grains at once.</p>

<p>“It was not as a cure that I took it,” he said, significantly.</p>

<p>But, strange to say, this terrific dose of poison, instead of killing
him, gave him for some time a respite from his sufferings.</p>

<p>When I was ten years old he sent me to a priest’s school in the town to
learn Latin, but the result not proving satisfactory he resolved to
teach me himself.</p>

<p>And with the most untiring patience, the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4">{4}</a></span> intense care, my father
became my instructor in history, literature, languages, geography&mdash;even
in music.</p>

<p>Yet I must own that I do not think a solitary education like mine half
as good for a boy as ordinary school life. Children brought up among
relations, servants, and specially chosen friends only, do not get
accustomed to the rough-and-tumble that best fits them to face the
world. Real life is to them a dosed book, their angles are not rubbed
off, and I know that, in my own case, at twenty-five I was still nothing
but an awkward, ignorant child.</p>

<p>Indulgent as my father was over my work, yet, for a long while, he was
unable to make me love the classics. It seemed impossible to me to
concentrate my thoughts long enough to learn by heart a few lines of
Horace and Virgil; impatient of the beaten track my wayward mind flew
off to the entrancing unknown world of the atlas, roving gaily through
the labyrinth of islands, capes, and straits of the Pacific and the
Indian Archipelago. This was the origin of my love for travel and
adventure.</p>

<p>My father truly said of me:</p>

<p>“He knows every isle of the South Seas, but cannot tell me how many
departments there are in France!”</p>

<p>Every book of travel in the library was pressed into my service, and I
should most certainly have run away to sea if we had lived in a seaport.
My son inherits my taste. He chose the navy for his profession long ere
he saw the sea. May he do honour to his choice!</p>

<p>However, in the end the love of poetry and appreciation of its beauty
awoke in me. The first spark of passion that fired my heart and
imagination was kindled by Virgil’s magnificent epic, and I well
remember how my voice broke as I tried to construe aloud the fourth book
of the Æneid. One day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5">{5}</a></span> stumbling along, I came to the passage where
Dido&mdash;the presents of Æneas heaped around her&mdash;gives up her life upon
the funeral pyre; the agony of the dying queen, the cries of her sister,
her nurse, her women; the horror of that scene that struck pity even to
the hearts of the Immortals, all rose so vividly before me that my lips
trembled, my words came more and more indistinctly, and at the line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Quæsivit cœlo lucem ingemuitque reperta,”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>I stopped dead.</p>

<p>Then my dear father’s delicate tact stepped in. Apparently noticing
nothing, he said, gently:</p>

<p>“That will do for to-day, my boy; I am tired.”</p>

<p>And I tore away to give vent to my Virgilian misery unmolested.</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II<br /><br />
<small>ESTELLE</small></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Will</span> it be credited that when I was only twelve years old, and even
before I fell under the spell of music, I became the victim of that
cruel passion so well described by the Mantuan?</p>

<p>My mother’s father, who bore a name immortalised by
Scott&mdash;Marmion&mdash;lived at Meylan, about seven miles from Grenoble. This
district, with its scattered hamlets, the valley of the winding Isère,
the Dauphiny mountains that here join a spur of the Alps, is one of the
most romantic spots I know. Here my mother, my sisters, and I usually
passed three weeks towards the end of summer.</p>

<p>Now and then my uncle, Felix Marmion, who followed the fiery track of
the great Emperor, would pay a flying visit during our stay, wreathed
with cannon smoke and ornamented with a fine sabre cut across the face.
He was then only<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span> adjutant-major in the Lancers; but young, gallant,
ready to lay down his life for one look from his leader, he believed the
throne of Napoleon as stable as Mont Blanc. His taste for music made him
a great addition to our gay little circle, for he both sang and played
the violin well.</p>

<p>High over Meylan, niched in a crevice of the mountain, stands a small
white house, half-hidden amidst its vineyards and gardens, behind which
rise the woods, the barren hills, a ruined tower, and St Eynard&mdash;a
frowning mass of rock.</p>

<p>This sweet secluded spot, evidently predestined to romance, was the home
of Madame Gautier, who lived there with two nieces, of whom the younger
was called Estelle. Her name at once caught my attention from its being
that of the heroine of Florian’s pastoral <i>Estelle and Némorin</i>, which I
had filched from my father’s library, and read a dozen times in secret.</p>

<p>Estelle was just eighteen&mdash;tall, graceful, with large, grave,
questioning eyes that yet could smile, hair worthy to ornament the
helmet of Achilles, and feet&mdash;I will not say Andalusian, but pure
Parisian, and on those little feet she wore ... pink slippers!</p>

<p>Never before had I seen pink slippers. Do not smile; I have forgotten
the colour of her hair (I fancy it was black), yet, never do I recall
Estelle but, in company with the flash of her large eyes, comes the
twinkle of her dainty pink shoes. I had been struck by lightning. To say
I loved her comprises everything. I hoped for, expected, knew nothing
but that I was wretched, dumb, despairing. By night I suffered agonies,
by day I wandered alone through the fields of Indian corn, or sought,
like a wounded bird, the deepest recesses of my grandfather’s orchard.</p>

<p>Jealousy&mdash;dread comrade of love&mdash;seized me at<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span> the least word spoken by
a man to my divinity; even now I shudder at the clank of a spur,
remembering the noise of my uncle’s while dancing with her.</p>

<p>Every one in the neighbourhood laughed at the piteously precocious
child, torn by his obsession. Perhaps Estelle laughed too, for she soon
guessed all.</p>

<p>One evening, I remember, there was a party at Madame Gautier’s, and we
played prisoner’s base. The men were bidden choose their partners, and I
was purposely told to choose first. But I dared not, my heart-beats
choked me; I lowered my eyes unable to speak. They were beginning to
tease me when Estelle, smiling down from her beauteous height, caught my
hand, saying:</p>

<p>“Come! I will begin; I choose Monsieur Hector.”</p>

<p>But ah! she laughed!</p>

<p>Does time heal all wounds; do other loves efface the first? Alas, no!
With me time is powerless. Nothing wipes out the memory of my first
love.</p>

<p>I was thirteen when we parted. I was thirty when, returning from Italy,
I passed near St Eynard again. My eyes filled with tears at the sight of
the little white house&mdash;the ruined tower. I loved her still!</p>

<p>On reaching home I heard that she was married; but even that could not
cure me. A few days later my mother said:</p>

<p>“Hector, will you take this letter to the coach-office. It is for a lady
who will be in the Vienne diligence. While they change horses ask the
guard for Madame F., give her this letter, and look carefully at her.
You may recognise her, although you have not met for seventeen years.”</p>

<p>Without suspicion I went on my errand and asked for Madame F. “I am she,
Monsieur,” said a voice that thrilled my heart. “It is Estelle,” said my
heart. Estelle! still lovely, still the nymph,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">{8}</a></span> the hamadryad of
Meylan’s green slopes. Still lovely with her proud carriage, her
glorious hair, her dazzling smile. But ah! where were the little pink
shoes? She took the letter. Did she know me? I could not tell, but I
returned home quite upset by the meeting. My mother smiled at me.</p>

<p>“So Némorin has not forgotten his Estelle,” she said. <i>His</i> Estelle!
Mother! mother! was that trick quite fair?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With love came music; when I say music I mean composition, for of course
I had long since been able to sing at sight and to play two instruments,
thanks, needless to say, to my father’s teaching.</p>

<p>Rummaging one day in a drawer, I unearthed a flageolet, on which I at
once tried to pick out “Malbrook.” Driven nearly mad by my squeaks, my
father begged me to leave him in peace until he had time to teach me the
proper fingering of the melodious instrument, and the right notes of the
martial song I had pitched on. At the end of two days I was able to
regale the family with my noble tune.</p>

<p>Now, how strikingly this shows my marvellous aptitude for wind
instruments. What a fruitful subject for a born biographer!</p>

<p>My father next taught me to read music, explaining the signs thoroughly,
and soon after he gave me a flute. At this I worked so hard that in
seven or eight months I could play quite fairly.</p>

<p>Wishing to encourage my talent, he persuaded several well-to-do families
of La Côte to join together and engage a music-master from Lyons. He was
successful in getting a second violin, named Imbert, to leave the
Théâtre des Célestins and settle in our outlandish little town to try
and musicalise the inhabitants, on condition that we guaranteed a
certain number of pupils and a fixed salary for conducting the band of
the National Guard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9">{9}</a></span></p>

<p>I improved fast, for I had two lessons a day; having also a pretty
soprano voice I soon developed into a pleasant singer, a bold reader,
and was able to play Drouet’s most intricate flute concertos. My master
had a son a few years older than myself, a clever horn-player, with whom
I became great friends. One day, as I was leaving for Meylan, he came to
see me.</p>

<p>“Were you going without saying good-bye?” he asked. “You may never see
me again.”</p>

<p>His gravity struck me at the moment, but the joy of seeing Meylan and my
glorious <i>Stella montis</i> quite put him out of my head. But on my return
home my friend was gone; he had hanged himself the very day I left, and
no one has ever been able to discover why. It was a sad home-coming for
me!</p>

<p>Among some old books I found d’Alembert’s edition of Rameau’s <i>Harmony</i>,
and how many weary hours did I not spend over those laboured theories,
trying vainly to evolve some sense out of the disconnected ideas. Small
wonder that I did not succeed, seeing that one needs to be a past master
of counterpoint and acoustics before one can possibly grasp the author’s
meaning. It is a treatise on harmony for the use of those only who know
all about it already.</p>

<p>However, I thought I could compose, and began by trying arrangements of
trios and quartettes that were simply chaos, without form, cohesion, or
common sense. Then, quite undaunted, I listened carefully to the
quartettes by Pleyel, that our music-lovers performed on Sundays, and
studied Catel’s <i>Harmony</i>, which I managed to buy. Suddenly I rent
asunder the veil of the inmost temple, and the mystery of form and of
the sequence of chords stood revealed. I hurriedly wrote a pot-pourri in
six parts on Italian airs, and, as the harmony seemed tolerable, I was
emboldened to compose a quintette<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10">{10}</a></span> for flute, two violins, viola, and
’cello, which was played by three amateurs, my master, and myself.</p>

<p>This was indeed a triumph though, unfortunately, my father did not seem
as pleased as my other friends. Two months later another quintette was
ready, of which he wished to hear the flute part before we performed it
in public. Like most provincial amateurs, he thought he could judge the
whole by a first-violin part, and at one passage he cried:</p>

<p>“Come now! That is something like music.”</p>

<p>But alas! this elaborate effusion was too much for our
performers&mdash;particularly the viola and ’cello&mdash;they meandered off at
their own sweet will. Result&mdash;confusion. As this happened when I was
twelve and a half, the writers who say I did not know my notes at twenty
are just a little out. Later on I burnt<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the two quintettes, but it is
strange that, long afterwards in Paris, I used the very <i>motif</i> that my
father liked for my first orchestral piece. It is the air in A flat for
the first violin in the allegro of my overture to the <i>Francs-Juges</i>.</p>

<small>MUSIC AND ANATOMY</small></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">After</span> the death of his son, poor Imbert went back to Lyons; his place
was taken by Dorant, a man of far higher standing. He was an Alsacian,
and played almost every instrument, but he excelled in clarinet, ’cello,
violin, and guitar. My elder sister&mdash;who had not a scrap of musical
instinct, and could never read the simplest song, although she had a
charming voice and was fond of music&mdash;learnt the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11">{11}</a></span> guitar with Dorant
and, of course, I must needs share her lessons. But ere long our master,
who was both honest and original, said bluntly to my father:</p>

<p>“Monsieur, I must stop your son’s guitar lessons.”</p>

<p>“But why? Is he rude to you or so lazy that you can do nothing with
him?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. Only it is simply absurd for me to pretend to teach
anyone who knows as much as I do myself.”</p>

<p>So behold me! Past master of those three noble instruments&mdash;flageolet,
flute, and guitar!</p>

<p>Can anyone doubt my heaven-sent genius or that I should be capable of
writing the most majestic orchestral works, worthy of a musical Michael
Angelo! Flute, guitar, flageolet!!! I never was any good at other
instruments. Oh yes! I am wrong, I am not at all bad at the side-drums.</p>

<p>My father would never let me learn the piano&mdash;if he had, no doubt I
should have joined the noble army of piano thumpers, just like forty
thousand others. Not wishing me to be a musician, he, I believe, feared
the effect of such an expressive instrument on my sensitive nature.
Sometimes I regret my ignorance, yet, when I think of the ghastly heap
of platitudes for which that unfortunate piano is made the daily
excuse&mdash;insipid, shameless productions, that would be impossible if
their perpetrators had to rely, as they ought, on pencil and paper
alone&mdash;then I thank the fates for having forced me to compose silently
and freely by saving me from the tyranny of finger-work&mdash;that grave of
original thought.</p>

<p>As with most young folks, my early work was downright gloomy, it simply
grovelled in melancholy. Minor keys were rampant. I knew it was a
mistake, but it seemed impossible to escape from the black crape folds
that had enshrouded my soul ever since the Meylan affair.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12">{12}</a></span></p>

<p>The natural result of constantly reading Florian’s <i>Estelle</i> was that I
ended by setting parts of that mawky pastoral to music.</p>

<p>The faded old-time poetry comes back to me as I write here in London, in
the pale spring sunshine. Torn as I am by anxiety, worried by sordid,
petty obstacles, by stupid opposition to my plans, it is strange to
recall the sickly-sentimental words of a song I wrote in despair at
leaving the Meylan woods, which were “lighted by the eyes”&mdash;and, may I
add, by the little pink slippers of my cruel lady love.</p>

<p>Although it joined the quintettes in the fire before I went to Paris,
yet in 1829, when I planned my <i>Symphonie Fantastique</i>, this little
melody crept humbly back into my mind; it seemed to me to voice so
perfectly the crushing weight of young and hopeless love that I welcomed
it home and enshrined it, without any alteration, for the first violins
in the largo of the opening movement&mdash;<i>Rêveries</i>.</p>

<p>But the fatal hour of choosing a profession drew rapidly nearer. My
father made no secret of his intention that I should follow in his
footsteps and become a doctor, since this he considered the finest
career in the world; I, on the other hand, made no secret of my opinion
that it was, to me, the most repulsive.</p>

<p>Without knowing exactly what I did want, I was absolutely certain that I
did <i>not</i> want to be tied to the bedsides of sick people, to pass my
days in hospitals and operating theatres, and I determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13" id="page_13">{13}</a></span> that no
power on earth should turn me into a doctor.</p>

<p>My resolve was intensified by the lives of Gluck and Haydn that I read
about this time in the “Biographie Universelle.” “How glorious,” I
cried, “to live for Art, to spend one’s life in her beautiful service!”
and then came a mere trifle which threw open the gates of that paradise
for which I had been so blindly groping.</p>

<p>As yet I had never seen a full score; all I knew of printed music was a
few scraps of solfeggi with figured bass or bits of operas with a piano
accompaniment. But one day I stumbled across a piece of paper ruled with
twenty-four staves, and, in a flash, I saw the splendid scope this would
give for all kinds of combinations.</p>

<p>“What orchestration I might get with that!” I said, and from that minute
my music-love became a madness equalled only in force by my aversion to
medicine.</p>

<p>As I dared not tell my parents, it happened that by means of this very
passion for music, my father tried decisive measures to cure me of what
he called my “babyish antipathy” to his loved profession.</p>

<p>Calling me into his study where Munro’s <i>Anatomy</i>, with its life-size
pictures of the human framework, lay open on the table, he said:</p>

<p>“See, my boy, I want you to work hard at this. I cannot believe that you
will let unreasoning prejudice stand in the way of my wishes. If you
will do your best, I will order you the very finest flute to be got in
Lyons, with all the new keys.”</p>

<p>What could I say? My father’s gravity, my love and respect for him, the
temptation of the long-coveted flute, were altogether too much for me.
Muttering a strangled “Yes,” I rushed away to throw myself on my bed in
the depths of misery.</p>

<p>Be a doctor! Learn to dissect! Help in horrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_14" id="page_14">{14}</a></span> operations! Bury myself
in the hideous realities of hospitals, wounds, and death, when I might
tread the clouds with the immortals!&mdash;when music and poetry wooed me
with open arms and divine songs.</p>

<p>No, no, no! Such a tragedy <i>could</i> not happen!</p>

<p>Yet it did.</p>

<p>My cousin, A. Robert&mdash;now one of the first doctors in Paris&mdash;was to
share my father’s lessons. Unluckily he played the violin well, being a
member of my quintette party, and, of course, we spent more time over
music than over osteology. Still he worked so hard at home that he was
always ready with his demonstrations, and I was not. Hence frequent
scoldings and the vials of my father’s wrath poured out on my poor head.
Nevertheless, by hook or by crook, I managed to learn all that my father
could teach me without dissections, and when I was nineteen, I consented
to go with Robert to Paris to embark on a medical career.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before beginning to tell of the deadly conflict that, almost immediately
on my arrival in Paris, I began with ideas, people and things generally,
and which has continued unremittingly up to this day, I must have a
short breathing space.</p>

<p>Moreover, to-day&mdash;the 10th April 1848&mdash;has been chosen for the great
Chartist demonstration. Perhaps, in a few hours, these two hundred
thousand men will have upset England, as the revolutionists have upset
the rest of Europe, and this last refuge will have failed me. I shall
know soon.</p>

<p>8 <small>P.M.</small>&mdash;Chartists are rather a decent sort of revolutionists. Those
powerful orators&mdash;big guns&mdash;took the chair, and their mere presence was
so convincing that speech was superfluous. The Chartists quite
understood that the moment was not propitious for a revolution, and they
dispersed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_15" id="page_15">{15}</a></span> quietly and in order. My good folks, you know as much about
organising an insurrection as the Italians do about composing
symphonies.</p>

<p><i>12th July.</i>&mdash;No possibility of writing for the last three months, and
now I am going back to my poor France&mdash;mine own country, after all! I am
going to see whether an artist can live there, or how long it will take
him to die amid those ruins beneath which Art lies&mdash;crushed, bleeding,
dead!</p>

<p>Farewell, England!</p>

<p><i>France, 16th July.</i>&mdash;Home once more. Paris has buried her dead. The
paving-stones, torn up for barricades, are replaced; but for how long?</p>

<p>The Faubourg Saint-Antoine is one mass of desolation and ruin; even the
Goddess of Liberty on the Bastille column has a bullet through her.
Trees, maimed and uprooted; houses tottering to a fall; squares,
streets, quays, still palpitating from the riot&mdash;all bear witness to the
horrors they have suffered.</p>

<p>Who could think of Art at such a time! Theatres are closed, artists
undone, professors idle, pupils fled, pianists become street musicians,
painters sweep the gutters, and architects mix mortar in the national
work-sheds.</p>

<p>Although the National Assembly has voted a subsidy to the theatres, and
some help to the poorest of the artists, what is that among so many?</p>

<p>Take a first violin of the opera, for instance; his pay is nine hundred
francs a year, which is eked out by private lessons. What chance has he
of saving? Transportation would be a boon to him and his colleagues, for
they might earn a living in America, Sydney, or the Indies. But even
this is denied them. They fought <i>for</i> the Government and against the
insurgents, and being only deserving poor instead of malefactors, they
cannot even claim this last favour&mdash;it is reserved for criminals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16" id="page_16">{16}</a></span></p>

<p>Surely this way&mdash;in this awful, hideous confusion of just and unjust, of
good and evil, of truth and untruth&mdash;this way doth madness lie!</p>

<p>I must write on and try to forget.</p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV<br /><br />
<small>PARIS</small></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">When</span> Robert and I got to Paris in 1822, I loyally kept my promise to my
father by studying nothing but medicine. My first trial came when my
cousin, telling me that he had bought a <i>subject</i>, took me to the
hospital dissecting room.</p>

<p>But the foul air, the grinning heads, the scattered limbs, the bloody
cloaca in which we waded, the swarms of ravenous rats and sparrows
fighting for the debris of poor humanity, overwhelmed me with such a
paroxysm of wild terror that, at one bound, I was through the nearest
window, and tearing home as if Death and the Devil were at my heels.</p>

<p>The following night and day were indescribable. Hell seemed let loose
upon me, and I felt that no power on earth should drag me back to that
Gehenna. The wildest schemes for evading my horrible fate&mdash;each madder
than the last&mdash;chased each other through my burning brain; but finally,
worn out and despairing, I yielded to Robert’s persuasion, and went back
to the charnel house.</p>

<p>Strange to say, this time I felt nothing but cold, impersonal disgust,
worthy of an old soldier in his fiftieth battle. I actually got to the
point of ferretting in some poor dead creature’s chest for scraps of
lung to feed the sparrow-ghouls of this unsavoury den, and when Robert
said, laughing:</p>

<p>“Hallo! you are getting quite civilised. Giving the birds their meat in
due season!”</p>

<p>I retorted: “And filling all things living with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17">{17}</a></span> plenteousness,” as I
threw a blade-bone to a wretched famished rat that sat up watching me
with anxious eyes.</p>

<p>Life, however, had some compensations.</p>

<p>Some secret affinity drew me to my anatomy demonstrator, Professor
Amussat, probably because he, like myself, was a man of one idea, and
was as passionately devoted to his science&mdash;medicine&mdash;as I to my beloved
art, music. His marvellous discoveries have brought him world-wide fame,
but, insatiable searcher after truth as he is, he takes no rest. He is a
genius, and I am honoured in being allowed to call him friend.</p>

<p>I also enjoyed the chemistry lectures of Gay-Lussac, of Thénard
(physics) and, above all, the literature course of Andrieux, whose quiet
humour was my delight.</p>

<p>Drifting on in this sort of dumb quiescence, I should probably have gone
to swell the disastrous list of commonplace doctors, had I not, one
night, gone to the Opera. It was Salieri’s <i>Danaïdes</i>.</p>

<p>The magnificent setting, the blended harmonies of orchestra and chorus,
the sympathetic and beautiful voice of Madame Branchu, the rugged force
of Dérivis, Hypermnestra’s air&mdash;which so vividly recalled Gluck’s style,
made familiar to me by the scraps of <i>Orpheus</i> I had found in my
father’s library&mdash;all this, intensified by the sad and voluptuous
dance-music of Spontini, sent me up to fever-pitch of excitement and
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>I was like a young man, who, never having seen any boat but the
cockle-shells on the mountain tarns of his homeland, is suddenly put on
board a great three-decker in the open ocean. I could not sleep, of
course, and consequently my next day’s anatomy lesson suffered, and to
Robert’s frenzied expostulations I responded with airs from the
<i>Danaïdes</i>, humming lustily as I dissected.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_18" id="page_18">{18}</a></span></p>

<p>Next week I went to hear Méhul’s <i>Stratonice</i> with Persuis’ ballet
<i>Nina</i>. I did not think much of the music, with the exception of the
overture, but I was greatly affected by hearing Vogt play on the <i>cor
anglais</i> the very air sung, years before, by my sister’s friends at my
first communion in the Ursuline chapel. A man sitting near told me that
it was taken from d’Aleyrac’s opera <i>Nina</i>.</p>

<p>In spite of this double life of mine and the hours spent in brooding
over my hard fate, I stuck doggedly to my promise for some time longer.
But, hearing that the Conservatoire library, with its wealth of scores,
was open to the public, I could not resist the temptation to go and
learn more of my adored Gluck. This gave the death-blow to my promise;
music claimed me for her own.</p>

<p>I read and re-read, I copied, I learnt Gluck’s scores by heart, I forgot
to eat, drink, or sleep, and when at last I managed to hear <i>Iphigenia
in Tauris</i>, I swore that, despite father, mother, relations and friends,
a musician I would be and nothing else.</p>

<p>Without waiting till my courage oozed away, I wrote to my father telling
him of my decision, and begging him not to oppose me. At first he
replied kindly, hoping that I should see the error of my ways; but, as
time went on, he realised that I was not to be persuaded, and our
letters grew more and more acrimonious, until they ended in a perfect
bombardment of mutual passion and recrimination.</p>

<p>In the midst of the storm I started composing, and wrote, amongst other
things, an orchestral cantata on Millevoye’s poem <i>The Arab Horse</i>.</p>

<p>I also, in the Conservatoire library, made friends with Gerono, a pupil
of Lesueur, and, to my great joy, he offered to introduce me to his
master, in the hope that I might be allowed to join his harmony class.
Armed with my cantata, and with a three-part canon as a sort of
aide-de-camp, I appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19" id="page_19">{19}</a></span> before him. Lesueur most kindly read through
the cantata carefully, and said: “You have plenty of dramatic force,
plenty of feeling, but you do not know how to write yet. The whole thing
is so crammed with mistakes that it would be simply waste of time for me
to point them out. Get Gerono to teach you harmony&mdash;just enough to make
my lectures intelligible&mdash;then I will gladly take you as a pupil.”</p>

<p>Gerono readily agreed, and, in a few weeks, I had mastered Lesueur’s
theory, based on Rameau’s chimera&mdash;the resonance of the lower chords, or
what he was pleased to call the bass figure&mdash;as if thick strings were
the only vibrating bodies in the world, or rather as if their vibrations
could be taken as the fundamental basis of vibration for all sonorous
bodies!</p>

<p>However, I saw from Gerono’s manner of laying down the law that I must
swallow it whole, since it was religion and must be blindly followed, or
else say good-bye to my chance of joining Lesueur’s class. And such is
the force of example that I ended by believing in it so thoroughly and
honestly that Lesueur considered me one of his most promising and
fervent disciples.</p>

<p>Do not think me ungrateful for his kindliness and for the affection he
shewed me up to his last hour, but, oh! the precious time wasted in
learning and unlearning his mouldy, antediluvian theories.</p>

<p>At one time I really did admire his little oratories, and it grieved me
sorely to find my admiration fading, slowly and surely. Now I can hardly
bear to look at one of his scores; it is to me as the portrait of a dear
friend, long loved, lost and lamented.</p>

<p>When I compare to-day with that far-off time when, regularly each
Sunday, I went to the Tuileries chapel to hear them, how old, how
tired,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_20" id="page_20">{20}</a></span> how bereft of illusions I feel. That was the day of great
enthusiasms, of rich musical passions, of beautiful dreams, of
ineffable, infinite joys.</p>

<p>As I usually arrived early at the Chapel Royal, my master would spend
the time before service began in explaining the meaning of his
composition. It was as well, for the music had no earthly connection
with the words of the mass!</p>

<p>Lesueur inclined mostly to the sweet pastorals of the Old
Testament&mdash;idylls of Naomi, Ruth, Rachel&mdash;and I shared his taste. The
calm of the unchanging East, the mysterious grandeur of its ruins, its
majestic history, its legends&mdash;these were the magnetic pole of my
imagination. He often allowed me to join him in his walks, telling me of
his early struggles, his triumphs and the favour of Napoleon. He even
let me, up to a certain point, discuss his theories, but we usually
ended on our common meeting-ground of Gluck, Virgil and Napoleon. After
these long talks along the edge of the Seine or under the leafy shade of
the Tuileries gardens, I would leave him to take the solitary walks
which had become to him a necessity of daily life.</p>

<p>Some months after I had become his pupil, but before my admission to the
Conservatoire, I took it into my head to write an opera, and nothing
would do but that I must get my witty literary master, Andrieux, to
write me a libretto. I cannot remember what I wrote to him, but he
replied:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<span class="smcap">Monsieur</span>,&mdash;Your letter interests me greatly. You cannot but
succeed in the glorious art you have chosen, and it would afford me
the greatest pleasure to be your collaborateur. But, alas! I am too
old, my studies and thoughts are turned in quite other directions.
You would call me an outer barbarian if I told you how long it is
since I set foot in the Opera. At sixty-four I can hardly be
expected to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_21" id="page_21">{21}</a></span> write love songs, a requiem would be more appropriate.
If only you had come into the world thirty years earlier, or I
thirty years later, we might have worked together. With heartiest
good wishes,</p>

<p class="r">
“<span class="smcap">Andrieux</span>.”<br />
</p>

<p>“<i>17th June 1823.</i>”</p></div>

<p>M. Andrieux kindly brought his own letter, and stayed a long time
chatting. As he was leaving he said:</p>

<p>“Ah! I, too, was an ardent lover of Gluck ... and of Piccini,<a name="FNanchor_2_3" id="FNanchor_2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_3" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> too!!”</p>

<p>This failure discouraged me, so I turned to Gerono, who was something of
a poetaster, and asked him (innocent that I was) to dramatise <i>Estelle</i>
for me. Luckily no one ever heard this lucubration, for my ditties were
a fair match for his words.</p>

<p>This pink-and-white namby-pamby effusion was followed by a dark and
dismal thing called <i>The Gamester</i>. I was really quite enamoured of this
sepulchral dirge, which was for a bass voice with orchestral
accompaniment, and I set my heart on getting Dérivis to sing it.</p>

<p>Just then the Theatre-Français advertised a benefit for
Talma&mdash;<i>Athalie</i>, with Gossec’s choruses. “With a chorus,” said I, “they
must have an orchestra. My scena is not difficult, and if only I can
persuade Talma to put it on the programme Dérivis will certainly not
refuse to sing it.”</p>

<p>Off I posted to Talma, my heart beating to suffocation&mdash;unlucky omen! At
the door I began to tremble, and desperate misgivings seized me. Dared I
beard Nero in his own palace? Twice my hand went up to the bell, twice
it dropped, then I turned and fled up the street as hard as I could
pelt.</p>

<p>I was but a half-tamed young savage even then!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22">{22}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V<br /><br />
<small>CHERUBINI</small></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">A short</span> time after this M. Masson, choirmaster of St Roch, suggested
that I should write a mass for Innocents’ Day.</p>

<p>He promised me a month’s practice, a hundred picked musicians, and a
still larger chorus. The choir boys of St Roch should copy the parts
carefully, so that that would cost me nothing.</p>

<p>I started gaily. Of course the whole thing was nothing but a
milk-and-water copy of Lesueur, and&mdash;equally of course&mdash;when I showed it
to him he gave most praise to those parts wherein my imitation was the
closest.</p>

<p>Masson swore by all his gods that the execution should be unrivalled,
the one thing needful being a good conductor, since neither he nor I was
used to handling such <i>vast masses of sound</i>. However, Lesueur most
kindly induced Valentino, conductor of the opera, to take the post,
dubious though he was of our vocal and instrumental legions.</p>

<p>The day of the general rehearsal came, and with it our <i>vast
masses</i>&mdash;twenty choristers (fifteen tenors and five basses), twelve
children, nine violins, one viola, one oboe, one horn, one bassoon.</p>

<p>My rage and despair at this treatment of Valentino&mdash;one of the first
conductors in the world&mdash;may be imagined.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” quoth Master Masson, “they will all turn up on the
day.”</p>

<p>Valentino shrugged his shoulders resignedly, raised his baton, and they
started.</p>

<p>In two seconds all was confusion; the parts were one mass of mistakes,
sharps and flats left out, ten-bar pauses omitted, a little further on
thirty bars clean gone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_23" id="page_23">{23}</a></span></p>

<p>It was the most appalling muddle ever heard, and I simply writhed in
torment. There was nothing for it but to give up utterly my fond dream
of a grand orchestral performance.</p>

<p>Still, it was not lost time as far as I was concerned, for, in spite of
the shocking execution, I saw where my worst faults lay, and, by
Valentino’s advice, I rewrote the whole mass&mdash;he generously promising to
help me when I should be ready for my revenge.</p>

<p>But alas! while I worked my parents heard of the fiasco, and made
another determined onslaught by ridiculing my chosen vocation, and
laughing my hopes to scorn. Those were the bitter dregs of my cup of
shame; I swallowed them and silently persevered.</p>

<p>Unable, for lack of money, to employ professional copyists, and being
justly afraid of amateurs, when my score was finished I wrote out every
part myself. It took me three months. Then, like Robinson Crusoe with
the boat he could not launch, I was at a stand-still. How should I get
it performed? Trust to M. Masson’s musical phalanx? That would be too
idiotic. Appeal to musicians myself? I knew none. Ask the help of the
Chapel Royal? My master had distinctly told me that was impossible, no
doubt because, had he allowed me such a privilege, he would have been
bombarded with similar requests from my fellow-students.</p>

<p>My friend, Humbert Ferrand, came to the rescue with a bold proposal. Why
not ask M. de Châteaubriand to lend me twelve thousand francs? I believe
that, on the principle of it being as well to be hanged for a sheep as a
lamb, I also asked for his influence with the Ministry. Here is his
reply:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
“<span class="smcap">Paris</span>, <i>31st Dec. 1824</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Monsieur</span>,&mdash;If I had twelve thousand francs you should have them.
Neither have I any influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_24" id="page_24">{24}</a></span> with the ministers. I am indeed sorry
for your difficulties, for I love art and artists. However, it is
through trial that success comes, and the day of triumph is a
thorough compensation for past sufferings. With most sincere
regret,</p>

<p class="r">
“<span class="smcap">Châteaubriand</span>.”<br />
</p></div>

<p>Thus I was completely disheartened, and had no plausible answer to make
when my parents wrote threatening to stop the modest sum that alone made
life in Paris possible.</p>

<p>Fortunately I met, at the opera, a young and clever music-lover,
Augustin de Pons, belonging to a Faubourg St Germain family, who,
stamping with impotent rage, had witnessed my disaster at St Roch. He
was fairly well off then, but, in defiance of his mother, he later on
married a second-rate singer, who left him after long wanderings through
France and Italy.</p>

<p>Entirely ruined he returned to Paris to vegetate by giving singing
lessons. I was able to be of some use to him when I was on the staff of
the <i>Journal des Débats</i>, and I greatly wish I could have done more, for
his generous and unasked help was the turning-point of my career, and I
shall never forget it.</p>

<p>Even last year he found life very hard; I tremble to think what may have
become of him since the February revolution took away his pupils.</p>

<p>Seeing me one day in the foyer, he shouted:</p>

<p>“I say, what about your mass? When shall we have another go at it?”</p>

<p>“It is done,” I answered, “but what chance have I of getting it
performed?”</p>

<p>“Chance? Why, confound it all, you have only got to pay the performers.
How much do you want? Twelve or fifteen hundred francs? Two thousand?”</p>

<p>“Hu-s-s-sh, don’t roar so, for heaven’s sake! If<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_25" id="page_25">{25}</a></span> you really mean it I
shall be most grateful for twelve hundred francs.”</p>

<p>“All right. Hunt me up to-morrow and we’ll engage the opera chorus and a
real good orchestra. We must give Valentino a good innings this time.”</p>

<p>And we did. The mass was grandly performed at St Roch, and was well
spoken of by the papers. Thus, thanks to that blessed de Pons, I got my
first hearing and my foot in the stirrup&mdash;as it were&mdash;of all things most
difficult and most important in Paris.</p>

<p>I boldly undertook to conduct the rehearsals of chorus and orchestra
myself, and, with the exception of a slip or two, due to excitement, I
did not do so badly. But alas! how far I was from being an accomplished
conductor, and how much labour and pains it has cost me to become even
what I am.</p>

<p>After the performance, seeing exactly how little my mass was worth, I
took out the Resurrexit&mdash;which seemed fairly good&mdash;and held an
<i>auto-da-fé</i> of the rest, together with the <i>Gamester</i>, <i>Estelle</i>, and
the <i>Passage of the Red Sea</i>. A calm inquisitorial survey convinced me
of the justice of their fate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mournful coincidence! After writing these lines I met a friend at the
Opéra Comique, who asked:</p>

<p>“When did you come back?”</p>

<p>“Some weeks ago.”</p>

<p>“Then you know about de Pons? No? He poisoned himself last week. He said
he was tired of living, but I am afraid that, really, he was unable to
live since the Revolution scattered his pupils.”</p>

<p>Horrible! horrible! most horrible!</p>

<p>I must rush out and work off this horror in the fresh air.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lesueur, seeing how well I got on, thought it best for me to become a
regular Conservatoire<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_26" id="page_26">{26}</a></span> student and, with the consent of Cherubini, the
director, I was enrolled.</p>

<p>It was a mercy I had not to appear before the formidable author of
<i>Medea</i>, for the year before I had put him into one of his white rages
by thwarting him.</p>

<p>Now the Conservatoire had not been run on precisely Puritanic lines, so,
when Cherubini succeeded Perne as director, he thought proper to begin
by making all sorts of vexatious rules. For instance, men must use only
the door into the Faubourg Poissonière and women that into the Rue
Bergère&mdash;which were at opposite ends of the building.</p>

<p>One day, knowing nothing of the new rule, I went in by the feminine
door, but was stopped by a porter in the middle of the courtyard and
told to go back and all round the streets to the masculine door. I told
the man I would be hanged if I did, and calmly marched on.</p>

<p>I had been buried in <i>Alcestis</i> for a quarter of an hour, when in burst
Cherubini, looking more wicked and cadaverous and dishevelled even than
usual. With my enemy, the porter, at his heels, he jerked round the
tables, narrowly eyeing each student, and coming at last to a dead stop
in front of me.</p>

<p>“That’s him,” said the porter.</p>

<p>Cherubini was so furious that, for a time, he could not speak, and, when
he did, his Italian accent made the whole thing more comical than
ever&mdash;if possible.</p>

<p>“Eh! Eh! Eh!” he stuttered, “so it is you vill come by ze door I vill
not ’ave you?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur, I did not know of the new rule; next time&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Next time? Vhat of zis next time? Vhat is it zat you come to do ’ere?”</p>

<p>“To study Gluck, Monsieur, as you see.”</p>

<p>“Gluck! and vhat is it to you ze scores of Gluck? Vhere get you
permission for enter ze library?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur” (I was beginning to lose my temper<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27" id="page_27">{27}</a></span> too), “the scores of
Gluck are the most magnificent dramatic works I know, and I need no
permission to use the library since, from ten to three, it is open to
all.”</p>

<p>“Zen I forbid zat you return.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, I shall return whenever I choose.”</p>

<p>That made him worse.</p>

<p>“Vha-Vha-Vhat is your name?” he stammered.</p>

<p>“My name, Monsieur, you shall hear some day, but not now.”</p>

<p>“Hotin,” to the porter, “catch ’im and make ’im put in ze prison.”</p>

<p>So off we went, the two&mdash;master and servant&mdash;hot foot after me round the
tables. We knocked over desks and stools in our headlong flight, to the
amazement of the quiet onlookers, but I dodged them successfully, crying
mockingly as I reached the door:</p>

<p>“You shan’t have either me or my name, and I shall soon be back here
studying Gluck.”</p>

<p>That was my first meeting with Cherubini, and I rather wondered whether
he would remember it when I met him next in a less irregular manner. It
is odd that, twelve years later, in spite of him, I should have been
appointed first curator, then librarian of that very library. As for
Hotin, he is now my devoted slave and a rabid admirer of my music. I
have many other Cherubini stories to tell. Any way, if he chastised me
with whips, I certainly returned the compliment with scorpions.</p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI<br /><br />
<small>MY FATHER’S DECISION</small></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> hostility of my people had somewhat died down, thanks to the success
of my mass, but, naturally another reverse started it with renewed fury.</p>

<p>In the 1826 preliminary examination of candidates<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_28" id="page_28">{28}</a></span> for admission to the
Institute I was hopelessly plucked. Of course my father heard of it, and
promptly wrote that, if I persisted in staying on in Paris, my allowance
would stop.</p>

<p>My dear master kindly wrote asking him to reconsider his letter, saying
that my eventual success was certain, since I <i>oozed music at every
pore</i>. But, by ill luck, he brought in religious arguments&mdash;about the
worst thing he could have done with my free-thinking father, whose
blunt&mdash;almost rude&mdash;answer could not but wound Lesueur on his most
susceptible side. From the beginning:</p>

<p>“Monsieur, I am an atheist,” the rest may be guessed. The forlorn hope
of gaining my end by personal pleading sent me back to La Côte, where I
was received frostily and left to my own reflections for some days,
during which I wrote to Ferrand:</p>

<p>“No sooner away from the capital than I want to talk to you. My journey
was tiresome as far as Tarare, where I began a conversation with two
young men, whom I had, so far, avoided, thinking they looked
<i>dilettanti</i>. They told me they were artists, pupils of Guérin and Gros,
so I told them I was a pupil of Lesueur. They said all sorts of nice
things of him, and one of them began humming a chorus from the
<i>Danaïdes</i>.</p>

<p>“The <i>Danaïdes</i>!” I cried, “then you are not a mere trifler?”</p>

<p>“Not I,” he answered; “have I not heard Dérivis and Madame Branchu
thirty-four times as Danaüs and Hypermnestra?”</p>

<p>“O-o-oh!” and we fell upon each other’s neck.</p>

<p>“I know Dérivis,” said the other man.</p>

<p>“And I Madame Branchu.”</p>

<p>“Lucky fellows!” I said. “But how is it that, since you are not
professional musicians, you have not caught Rossini fever and turned
your backs on nature and common sense?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_29" id="page_29">{29}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose it is because, being used to seeking all that is
grandest and best in nature for our pictures, we recognise the same
spirit in Gluck and Salieri, and so turn our backs on fashionable
music.”</p>

<p>“Blessed people! Such as they are alone worthy of being allowed to
listen to <i>Iphigenia</i>!”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Again my parents returned to the charge, telling me to choose my
profession, since I refused to be a doctor. Again I replied that I could
and would only be a musician and must return to Paris to study.</p>

<p>“Never,” said my father, “you may give up that idea at once.”</p>

<p>I was crushed; with paralysed brain I sank into a torpor from which
nothing roused me. I neither ate nor spoke nor answered when spoken to,
but spent part of the day wandering in the woods and fields and the rest
shut up in my own room. I was mentally and morally dying for want of
air. Early one morning my father came to my bedside:</p>

<p>“Get up and come to my study,” he said, “I want to talk to you.” He was
grave and sad, not angry.</p>

<p>“I have decided, after many sleepless nights, that you shall go back to
Paris, but only for a time. If you should fail on further trial, I think
you will do me the justice to own that I have done all that can be
expected, and will consent to try some other career. You know my opinion
of second-rate poets&mdash;every sort of mediocrity is contemptible&mdash;and it
would be a deadly humiliation to feel that you were numbered among the
failures of the world.”</p>

<p>Without waiting to hear more, I promised all he wished. “But,” he
continued, “since your mother’s point of view is diametrically opposed
to mine, I desire, in order to avoid trouble, that you do not mention
this, and that you start for Paris secretly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30" id="page_30">{30}</a></span>”</p>

<p>But it was impossible to hide this sudden bound from utter despair to
delirious joy and Nanci, my sister, with many promises not to tell,
wormed my secret out of me. Of course she kept it as well as I did, and
by nightfall, everyone, including my mother, knew my plans.</p>

<p>Now it will hardly be believed that there are still people in France who
look upon anyone connected with theatres or theatrical art as doomed to
everlasting perdition, and since, according to French ideas, music
hardly exists outside a theatre, it, too, shares the same fate.</p>

<p>Apropos of this I nearly made Lesueur die of laughing over a reply of
one of my aunts.</p>

<p>We were arguing on this very point, and I said at last:</p>

<p>“Come, Auntie, I believe you would object to have even Racine a member
of your family!”</p>

<p>“Well, Hector,” she said seriously, “we <i>must</i> be respectable before
everything.”</p>

<p>Lesueur insisted that such sentiments could only emanate from an elderly
maiden aunt, in spite of my asseverations that she was young and as
pretty as a flower.</p>

<p>Needless to say, my mother believed I was setting my feet in the broad
road that led not only to destruction in the next world, but to social
ruin in this. I quickly saw by her wrathful face that she knew all, and
did my best to slink out of her way, but it was useless. Trembling with
rage and using “you” instead of the old familiar “thou,” she said:</p>

<p>“Hector, since your father countenances your folly I must speak and save
you from this mortal sin. You shall not go; I forbid it. See, here
I&mdash;your mother&mdash;kneel at your feet to beg you humbly to give up this mad
design and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Mother! mother!” I interrupted, “I cannot bear it! For pity’s sake
don’t kneel to me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_31" id="page_31">{31}</a></span>”</p>

<p>But she knelt on, looking up at me as I stood in miserable silence, and
finally she said:</p>

<p>“You refuse, wretched boy? Then go! Drag our honoured name through the
fetid mud of Paris; kill your parents with shame and disgrace. Curses on
you! You are no more my son, and never again will I look upon your
face.”</p>

<p>Could narrow-mindedness towards Art and provincial prejudice go farther?
I truly believe that my hatred of these mediæval doctrines dates from
that horrible day.</p>

<p>But that was not the end of the trial.</p>

<p>My mother hurried off to our little country house, Le Chuzeau, and when
the time of my departure came my father begged me to make one final
effort at reconciliation. We all went to Le Chuzeau, where we found her
reading in the orchard. As we drew near she fled. We waited, we hunted,
my father called her, my sisters and I cried bitterly, but all in vain.
Without a kind word or look from my mother, with her curse upon my head,
I started on my life’s career.</p>

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII<br /><br />
<small>PRIVATION</small></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Once</span> back in Paris, and fairly started in Lesueur’s class, I began to
worry about my debt to de Pons.</p>

<p>It would certainly never be paid off out of my monthly allowance of a
hundred and twenty francs. I therefore got some pupils for singing,
flute and guitar, and, by dint of strict economy, in a few months I
scraped together six hundred francs, with which I hurried off to my kind
creditor.</p>

<p>How could I save out of such a sum? Well, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32" id="page_32">{32}</a></span> had a tiny fifth-floor room
at the corner of the Rue de Harley and the Quai des Orfèvres, I gave up
restaurant dinners and contented myself with a meal of dry bread with
prunes, raisins or dates, which cost about fourpence.</p>

<p>As it was summer time I took my dainties, bought at the nearest
grocer’s, and ate them on that little terrace on the Pont Neuf at the
foot of Henry IV.’s statue; watching the while the sun set behind Mont
Valerien, with its exquisite reflections in the murmuring river below,
and pondering over Thomas Moore’s poems, of which I had lately found a
translation.</p>

<p>But de Pons, troubled at my privations&mdash;which, since we often met, I
could not hide from him&mdash;brought fresh disaster upon me by a piece of
well-meant but fatal interference. He wrote to my father, telling him
everything, and asking for the balance of his debt. Now my father
already repented bitterly his leniency towards me; here had I been five
months in Paris without in the least bettering my position. No doubt he
thought that I had nothing to do but present myself at the Institute to
carry all before me: win the Prix de Rome, write a successful opera, get
the Legion of Honour, and a Government pension, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Instead of this came news of an unpaid debt. It was a blow and naturally
reacted on me.</p>

<p>He sent de Pons his six hundred francs, and told me that, if I refused
to give up my musical wild-goose chase, I must depend on myself alone,
for he would help me no more.</p>

<p>As de Pons was paid, and I had my pupils, I decided to stay in Paris&mdash;my
life would be no more frugal than heretofore. I was really working very
steadily at music. Cherubini, of the orderly mind, knowing I had not
gone through the regular Conservatoire mill to get into Lesueur’s class,
said<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_33" id="page_33">{33}</a></span> I must go into Reicha’s counterpoint class, since that should have
preceded the former. This, of course, meant double work.</p>

<p>I had also, most happily, made friends some time before with a young man
named Humbert Ferrand&mdash;still one of my closest friends&mdash;who had written
the <i>Francs-Juges</i> libretto for me, and in hot haste I was writing the
music.</p>

<p>Both poem and music were refused by the Opera committee and were
shelved, with the exception of the overture; I, however, used up the
best <i>motifs</i> in other ways. Ferrand also wrote a poem on the Greek
Revolution, which at that time fired all our enthusiasm; this too I
arranged. It was influenced entirely by Spontini, and was the means of
giving my innocence its first shock at contact with the world, and of
awakening me rudely to the egotism of even great artists.</p>

<p>Rudolph Kreutzer was then director of the Opera House, where, during
Holy Week, some sacred concerts were to be given. Armed with a letter of
introduction from Monsieur de Larochefoucauld, Minister of Fine Arts,
and with Lesueur’s warm commendations, I hoped to induce Kreutzer to
give my scena.</p>

<p>Alas for youthful illusions!</p>

<p>This great artist&mdash;author of the <i>Death of Abel</i>, on which I had written
him heaven only knows what nonsense some months before&mdash;received me most
rudely.</p>

<p>“My good friend” (he did not know me in the least), he said shortly,
turning his back on me, “we can’t try new things at sacred concerts&mdash;no
time to work at them. Lesueur knows that perfectly well.”</p>

<p>With a swelling heart I went away.</p>

<p>The following Sunday Lesueur had it out with him in the Chapel Royal,
where he was first violin. Turning on my master in a temper, he said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_34" id="page_34">{34}</a></span></p>

<p>“Confound it all! If we let in all these young folks, what is to become
of us?”</p>

<p>He was at least plain spoken!</p>

<p>Winter came on apace. In working at my opera I had rather neglected my
pupils, and my Pont Neuf dining-room, growing cold and damp, was no
longer suitable for my feasts of Lucullus.</p>

<p>How should I get warm clothes and firewood? Hardly from my lessons at a
franc a piece, since they might stop any day.</p>

<p>Should I write to my father and acknowledge myself beaten, or die of
hunger in Paris? Go back to La Côte to vegetate? Never. The mere idea
filled me with maddening energy, and I resolved to go abroad to join
some orchestra in New York or Mexico, to turn sailor, buccaneer, savage,
anything, rather than give in.</p>

<p>I can’t help my nature. It is about as wise to sit on a gunpowder barrel
to prevent it exploding as it is to cross my will.</p>

<p>I was nearly at my wits’ end when I heard that the Théâtre des
Nouveautés was being opened for vaudeville and comic opera. I tore off
to the manager to ask for a flautist’s place in the orchestra. All
filled! A chorus singer’s? None left, confound it all! However the
manager took my address and promised to let me know if, by any
possibility there should be a vacancy. Some days later came a letter
saying that I might go and be examined at the Freemason’s Hall, Rue de
Grenelle. There I found five or six poor wights in like case with
myself, waiting in sickening anxiety&mdash;a weaver, a blacksmith, an
out-of-work actor and a chorister. The management wanted basses, my
voice was nothing but a second-rate baritone; how I prayed that the
examiner might have a deaf ear.</p>

<p>The manager appeared with a musician named Michel, who still belongs to
the Vaudeville<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_35" id="page_35">{35}</a></span> orchestra. His fiddle was to be our only accompaniment.</p>

<p>We began. My rivals sang, in grand style, carefully prepared songs, then
came my turn. Our huge manager (appropriately blessed with the name of
St Leger) asked what I had brought.</p>

<p>“I? Why nothing.”</p>

<p>“Then what do you mean to sing?”</p>

<p>“Whatever you like. Haven’t you a score, some singing exercise,
anything?”</p>

<p>“No. And besides”&mdash;with resigned contempt&mdash;“I don’t suppose you could
sing at sight if we had.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, I will sing at sight anything you give me.”</p>

<p>“Well, since we have no music, do you know anything by heart?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I know the <i>Danaïdes</i>, <i>Stratonice</i>, the <i>Vestal</i>, <i>Œdipus</i>, the
two <i>Iphigenias</i>, <i>Orpheus</i>, <i>Armida</i>&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There, that will do! That will do! what a devil of a memory you must
have! Since you are such a prodigy, give us “<i>Elle m’a prodigué</i>” from
Sacchini’s <i>Œdipus</i>. Can you accompany him, Michel?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. In what key?”</p>

<p>“E flat. Do you want the recitative too?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Let’s have it all.”</p>

<p>And the glorious melody:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Antigone alone is left me,”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">rolled forth, while the poor listeners, with pitifully down-cast faces,
glanced at each other recognising that, though I might be bad, they were
infinitely worse.</p>

<p>The following day I was engaged at a salary of fifty francs a month.</p>

<p>And this was the result of my parents’ efforts to save me from the
bottomless pit! Instead of a cursed dramatic composer I had become a
damned<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_36" id="page_36">{36}</a></span> theatre chorus-singer, excommunicated with bell, book and
candle. Surely my last state was worse than my first!</p>

<p>One success brought others. The smiling skies rained down two new pupils
and a fellow-provincial, Antoine Charbonnel, whom I met when he came up
to study as an apothecary. Neither of us having any money, we&mdash;like
Walter in the <i>Gambler</i>&mdash;cried out together:</p>

<p>“What! no money either? My dear fellow, let’s go into partnership.”</p>

<p>We rented two small rooms in the Rue de la Harpe and, since Antoine was
used to the management of retorts and crucibles, we made him cook. Every
morning we went marketing and I, to his intense disgust, would insist on
bringing back our purchases under my arm without trying to hide them.
Oh, pharmaceutical gentility! it nearly landed us in a quarrel.</p>

<p>We lived like princes&mdash;exiled ones&mdash;on thirty francs a month each. Never
before in Paris had I been so comfortable. I began to develop
extravagant ideas, bought a piano&mdash;<i>such</i> a thing! it cost a hundred and
ten francs. I knew I could not play it, but I like trying chords now and
then. Besides, I love to be surrounded by musical instruments and, were
I only rich enough, would work in company with a grand piano, two or
three Erard harps, some wind instruments and a whole crowd of
Stradivarius violins and ’cellos.</p>

<p>I decorated my room with framed portraits of my musical gods, and
Antoine, who was as clever as a monkey with his fingers (not a very good
simile, by-the-way, since monkeys only destroy) made endless little
useful things&mdash;amongst others a net with which, in spring-time, he
caught quails at Montrouge, to vary our Spartan fare.</p>

<p>But the humour of the whole situation lay in the fact that, although I
was out every evening at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_37" id="page_37">{37}</a></span> theatre, Antoine never guessed&mdash;during the
whole time we lived together&mdash;that I had the ill-luck to <i>tread the
boards</i> and, not being exactly proud of my position, I did not see the
force of enlightening him. He supposed I was giving lessons at the other
end of Paris.</p>

<p>It seems as if his silly pride and mine were about on a par. Yet no;
mine was not all foolish vanity. In spite of my parents’ harshness, for
nothing in the world would I have given them the intense pain of knowing
how I gained my living. So I held my tongue and they only heard of my
theatrical career&mdash;as did Antoine Charbonnel&mdash;some seven or eight years
after it ended, through biographical notices in some of the papers.</p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII<br /><br />
<small>FAILURE</small></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">It</span> was at this time that I wrote the <i>Francs-Juges</i> and, after it,
<i>Waverley</i>. Even then, I was so ignorant of the scope of certain
instruments that, having written a solo in D flat for the trombones in
the introduction to the <i>Francs-Juges</i>, I got into a sudden panic lest
it should be unplayable.</p>

<p>However one of the trombone players at the opera, to whom I showed it,
set my mind at rest.</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” said he, “D flat is a capital key for the trombone;
that passage ought to be most effective.”</p>

<p>Overjoyed, I went home with my head so high in the air that I could not
look after my feet, whereby I sprained my ankle. I never hear that thing
now without feeling my foot ache; probably other people get the ache in
their heads.</p>

<p>Neither of my masters could help me in the least in orchestration&mdash;it
was not in their line. Reicha<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_38" id="page_38">{38}</a></span> did certainly know the capacity of most
wind instruments, but I do not think he knew anything of the effect of
grouping them in different ways; besides it had nothing to do with his
department, which was counterpoint and fugue. Even now it is not taught
at the Conservatoire.</p>

<p>However, before being engaged at the Nouveautés I had made the
acquaintance of a friend of Gardel, the well-known ballet-master, and he
often gave me pit tickets for the opera, so that I could go regularly.</p>

<p>I always took the score and read it carefully during the performance, so
that, in time, I got to know the sound&mdash;the voice, as it were&mdash;of each
instrument and the part it filled; although, of course, I learnt nothing
of either its mechanism or compass.</p>

<p>Listening so closely, I also found out for myself the intangible bond
between each instrument and true musical expression.</p>

<p>The study of Beethoven, Weber and Spontini and their systems; searching
enquiry into the gifts of each instrument; careful investigation of rare
or unused combinations; the society of <i>virtuosi</i> who kindly explained
to me the powers of their several instruments, and a certain amount of
instinct have done the rest for me.</p>

<p>Reicha’s lectures were wonderfully helpful, his demonstrations being
absolutely clear because he invariably gave the reason for each rule. A
thoroughly open-minded man, he believed in progress, thereby coming into
frequent collision with Cherubini, whose respect for the masters of
harmony was simply slavish.</p>

<p>Still, in composition Reicha kept strictly to rule. Once I asked his
candid opinion on those figures, written entirely on <i>Amen</i> or <i>Kyrie
eleison</i>, with which the Requiems of the old masters bristle.</p>

<p>“They are utterly barbarous!” he cried hotly.</p>

<p>“Then, Monsieur, why do you write them?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_39" id="page_39">{39}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“Oh, confound it all! because everyone else does.”</p>

<p>Miseria!</p>

<p>Now Lesueur was more consistent. He considered these monstrosities more
like the vociferations of a horde of drunkards than a sacred chorus, and
he took good care to avoid them. The few found in his works have not the
slightest resemblance to them, and indeed his</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Quis enarrabit cœlorum gloriam”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">is a masterpiece of form, style and dignity.</p>

<p>Those composers who, by writing such abominations, have truckled to
custom, have prostituted their intelligence and unpardonably insulted
their divine muse.</p>

<p>Before coming to France Reicha had been in Bonn with Beethoven, but I do
not think they had much in common. He set great value on his
mathematical studies.</p>

<p>“Thanks to them,” he used to say, “I am master of my mind. To them I owe
it that my vivid imagination has been tamed and brought within bounds,
thereby doubling its power.”</p>

<p>I am not at all sure that his theory was correct. It is quite possible
that his love for intricate and thorny musical problems made him lose
sight of the real aim of music, and that what the eye gained by his
curious and ingenious solution of difficulties the ear did not lose in
melody and true musical expression.</p>

<p>For praise or blame he cared nothing; he lived only to forward his
pupils, on whom he lavished his utmost care and attention.</p>

<p>At first I could see that he found my everlasting questions a perfect
nuisance, but in time he got to like me. His wind instrumental
quintettes were fashionable for a time in Paris; they are interesting
but cold. On the other hand, I remember hearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_40" id="page_40">{40}</a></span> a magnificent duet,
from his opera <i>Sappho</i>, full of fire and passion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the Conservatoire examinations of 1827 came on I went up again, and
fortunately passed the preliminary, thereby becoming eligible for the
general competition.</p>

<p>The subject set was Orpheus torn by the Bacchantes. I think my version
was fair, but the incompetent pianist who was supposed to do duty for an
orchestra (such is the incredible arrangement at these contests) not
being able to make head or tail of my score, the powers that were&mdash;to
wit, Cherubini, Päer, Lesueur, Berton, Boïeldieu and Catel, the musical
section of the Institute&mdash;decided that my music was impracticable, and I
was put out of court.</p>

<p>So, after my Kreutzer experience of selfish jealousy, I now had a sample
of wooden-headed sticking to the letter of the law. In thus taking away
my modest chance of distinction did none of them think of the
consequences of driving me to despair like this?</p>

<p>I had got a fortnight’s leave from the Nouveautés for the competition;
when it was over I should have again to take up my burden. But just as
the time expired I fell ill with a quinsy that nearly made an end of me.</p>

<p>Antoine was always trotting after grisettes and left me almost entirely
alone. I believe I should have died without help had I not one night, in
a fit of desperation, stuck a pen-knife into the abscess that choked me.
This somewhat unscientific operation saved me, and I was beginning to
mend when my father&mdash;no doubt touched by my steady patience and perhaps
anxious as to my means of livelihood&mdash;wrote and restored me my
allowance.</p>

<p>Thanks to this unhoped-for kindness, I gave up<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_41" id="page_41">{41}</a></span> chorus-singing&mdash;no small
relief, since, apart from the actual bodily fatigue, the idiotic music I
had to suffer from would soon have either given me cholera or turned me
into a drivelling lunatic.</p>

<p>Free from my dreary trade I gave myself up, with redoubled zest, to my
Opera evenings and to the study of dramatic music. I never thought of
instrumental, since the only concerts I had heard were the cold and mean
Opera performances, of which I was not greatly enamoured. Haydn and
Mozart, played by an insufficient orchestra in too large a building,
made about as much effect as if they had been given on the <i>plaine de
Grenelle</i>. Beethoven, two of whose symphonies I had read, seemed a sun
indeed, but a sun obscured by heavy clouds. Weber’s name was unknown to
me, while as for Rossini&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The very mention of him and of the fanaticism of fashionable Paris for
him put me in a rage that is not lessened by the obvious fact that he is
the antithesis of Gluck and Spontini. Believing these great masters
perfect, how could I tolerate his puerilities, his unmerciful big drum,
his constant repetition of one form of cadence, his contempt for great
traditions? My prejudice blinded me even to this exquisite
instrumentation of the <i>Barbiere</i> (without the big drum too!) and I
longed to blow up the <i>Théâtre Italien</i> with all its Rossinian audience
and so put an end to it at one fell swoop. When I met one of the tribe I
eyed him with a Shylockian scowl.</p>

<p>“Miscreant!” I growled between my teeth, “would that I might impale thee
on a red-hot iron.”</p>

<p>Time has not changed my opinion, and though I think I can refrain from
blowing up a theatre and impaling people on hot irons, I quite agree
with our great painter, Ingres, who, speaking of some of Rossini’s work,
said:</p>

<p>“It is the music of a vulgar-minded man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_42" id="page_42">{42}</a></span>”</p>

<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX<br /><br />
<small>A NIGHT AT THE OPERA</small></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Here</span> is a picture of one of my opera evenings.</p>

<p>It was a serious business for which I prepared by reading over and
studying whatever was to be given.</p>

<p>My faithful pit friends and I had but one religion, with one god, Gluck,
and I was his high priest. Our fanaticism for our favourites was only
equalled by our frantic hatred of all composers whom we judged to be
without the pale.</p>

<p>Did one of my fellow-worshippers tremble or waver in his faith, promptly
would I drag him off to the opera to retract&mdash;even going so far
sometimes as to pay for his ticket. On one special seat would I place my
victim, saying, “Now for pity’s sake don’t move. Nowhere else can you
hear so well&mdash;I know because I have tried the right place for every
opera.”</p>

<p>Then I would begin to expound, reading and explaining obscure passages
as I went along; we were always in very good time, first to get the
places we wanted; next, so as not to miss the opening notes of the
overture; lastly, in order to taste to the uttermost the exciting,
thrilling expectation of a great pleasure of which one knows the
realisation will exceed one’s hopes. The gradual filling of the
orchestra&mdash;at first as dreary as a stringless harp; the distribution of
the parts&mdash;an anxious moment this, for the opera might have been
changed; the joy of reading the hoped-for title on the desks of the
double-basses, which were nearest to us; or the horror of seeing it was
replaced by some wretched little drivel like Rousseau’s <i>Devin du
Village</i>&mdash;when we would rush out in a body, swearing at all and sundry.</p>

<p>Poor Rousseau! What would he have said if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_43" id="page_43">{43}</a></span> could have heard our
curses? He, who thought more of his feeble little opera than of all the
masterpieces through which his name lives. How could he foresee that it
would some day be extinguished for ever by a huge powdered periwig,
thrown at the heroine’s feet by some irreverent scoffer. As it happened,
I was present that very night and, naturally, kind friends credited me
with this little unrehearsed effect. I am really quite innocent, I even
remember being quite as angry about it as I was amused&mdash;so I do not
think I should or could have done such a thing. Since that night of
joyous memory the poor <i>Devin</i> has appeared no more.</p>

<p>But to go back to my story.</p>

<p>Reassured on the subject of the performance, I continued my preachment,
singing the leading motifs, explaining the orchestration and doing my
best to work my little gang up to a pitch of enthusiasm, to the great
wonderment of our neighbours who&mdash;mostly simple country folks&mdash;were so
wrought upon by my speeches that they quite expected to be carried away
by their emotions, wherein they were usually grievously disappointed.</p>

<p>I also named each member of the orchestra as he came in and gave a
dissertation on his playing until I was stopped short by the three
knocks behind the scenes. Then we sat with beating hearts awaiting the
signal from Kreutzer or Valentino’s raised baton. After that, no
humming, no beating time on the part of our neighbours. Our rule was
Draconian.</p>

<p>Knowing every note of the score, I would have let myself be chopped in
pieces rather than let the conductor take liberties with it. Wait
quietly and write my expostulations? Not exactly! No half-measures for
me!</p>

<p>There and then I would publicly denounce the sinners and my remarks went
straight home.</p>

<p>For instance, I noticed one day that in <i>Iphigenia in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_44" id="page_44">{44}</a></span> Tauris</i> cymbals
had been added to the Scythian dance, whereas Gluck had only employed
strings, and in the Orestes recitative, the trombones, that come in so
perfectly appropriately, were left out altogether.</p>

<p>I decided that if these barbarisms were repeated I would let them know
it and I lay in wait for my cymbals.</p>

<p>They appeared.</p>

<p>I waited, although boiling over with rage, until the end of the
movement, then, in the moment’s silence that followed, I yelled:</p>

<p>“Who dares play tricks with Gluck and put cymbals where there are none?”</p>

<p>The murmuring around may be imagined. The public, not being particularly
critical, could not conceive why that young idiot in the pit should get
so excited over so little. But it was worse when the absence of the
trombones made itself evident in the recitative.</p>

<p>Again that fatal voice was heard:</p>

<p>“Where are those trombones? This is simply outrageous!”</p>

<p>The astonishment of audience and orchestra were fairly matched by
Valentino’s very natural anger. I heard afterwards that the unlucky
trombones were only obeying orders; their parts were quite correctly
written.</p>

<p>After that night the proper readings were restored, the cymbals were
silent, the trombones spoke; I was serene.</p>

<p>De Pons, who was just as crazy as I on this point, helped me to put
several other points straight but once we went too far and dragged in
the public at our heels.</p>

<p>A violin solo advertised for Baillot was left out. We clamoured for it
furiously, the pit fired up, then the whole house rose and howled for
Baillot. The curtain fell on the confusion, the musicians fled<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_45" id="page_45">{45}</a></span>
precipitately, the audience dashed into the orchestra smashing
everything they could lay hands on and only stopping when there was
nothing left to smash.</p>

<p>In vain did I cry:</p>

<p>“Messieurs, messieurs! what are you doing? To break the instruments is
too barbarous. That’s Father Chénié’s glorious double-bass with its
diabolic tone.”</p>

<p>But they were too far gone to listen, and the havoc was complete.</p>

<p>This was the bad side of our unofficial criticism; the good side was our
wild enthusiasm when all went well. How we applauded anything
superlative that no one noticed, such as a fine bass, a happy
modulation, a telling note of the oboe! The public took us for embryo
<i>claqueurs</i>, the <i>claque</i> leader, who knew better and whose little plans
were upset, tried to wither us with thunderbolt glances, but we were
bomb-proof.</p>

<p>There is no such enthusiasm in France nowadays, not even in the
Conservatoire, its last remaining stronghold.</p>

<p>Here is the funniest scene I ever remember at the opera. I had swept off
Leon de Boissieux, an unwilling proselyte, to hear <i>Œdipus</i>; however,
nothing but billiards appealed to him, and, finding him utterly
impervious to the woes of Antigone and her father, I stepped over into a
seat in front, giving him up in despair.</p>

<p>But he had a music-loving neighbour and this is what I heard, while my
young man was peeling an orange and casting apprehensive glances at the
other man, who was evidently in a state of wild excitement.</p>

<p>“Sir, for pity’s sake, do try to be calm.”</p>

<p>“Impossible! It’s killing me! It is so terrible, so overwhelming!”</p>

<p>“My good man, you will be ill if you go on like this. You really
shouldn’t.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_46" id="page_46">{46}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“Oh! oh! Leave me alone! Oh!”</p>

<p>“Come! come! Do cheer up a bit. Remember it is nothing but a play. Here,
take a piece of my orange.”</p>

<p>“It’s sublime&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s Maltese&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What glorious art!”</p>

<p>“Don’t say ‘No.’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

<p>“Oh, sir! what music!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s not bad.”</p>

<p>By this time the opera had got to the lovely trio, “Sweet Moments,” and
the exquisite delicacy of the simple air overcame me too. I hid my face
in my hands, and tears trickled between my fingers. I might have been
plunged in the depths of woe.</p>

<p>As the trio ended two strong arms lifted me off my seat, nearly crushing
my breast-bone in; the enthusiast, recognising one fellow-worshipper
amongst the cold-blooded lot around, hugged me furiously, crying:</p>

<p>“B-b-b-by Jove, sir! isn’t it beautiful?”</p>

<p>“Are you a musician?”</p>

<p>“No, but I am as fond of it as if I were.”</p>

<p>Then, regardless of surrounding giggles and of my orange-devouring
neophyte, we exchanged names and addresses in a whisper.</p>

<p>He was an engineer, a mathematician! Where, the devil, will true musical
perception next find a lodging, I wonder? His name was Le Tessier, but
we never met again.</p>

<h2><a name="X" id="X"></a>X<br /><br />
<small>WEBER</small></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Into</span> the midst of this stormy student life of mine came the revelation
of Weber, by means of a miserable, distorted version of <i>Der
Freyschütz</i>, called <i>Robin des Bois</i>, which was performed at the Odéon.
The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_47" id="page_47">{47}</a></span> orchestra was good, the chorus fair, the soloists simply appalling.</p>

<p>One wretched woman alone, Madame Pouilley, by the imperturbably wooden
way in which she went through her part&mdash;even that glorious air in the
second act&mdash;would have been enough to wreck the whole opera. Small
wonder that it took me a long while to unearth all the beauty of its
hidden treasures.</p>

<p>The first night it was received with hisses and laughter, the next the
audience began to see something in the Huntsmen’s Chorus, and they let
the rest pass. Then they rather fancied the Bridesmaid’s Chorus and
Agatha’s Prayer, half of which was cut out. A glimmering notion that
Max’s great aria was fairly dramatic followed; finally it burst upon
them that the Wolf’s Glen scene was really quite comic; so all Paris
rushed to see this misshapen horror, the Odéon got rich, and Castilblaze
netted a hundred thousand francs for destroying a masterpiece.</p>

<p>Now I must own frankly that I was getting rather tired of high tragedy,
in spite of my conservatism, and, chopped about as it was, the sweet
wild savour of this woodland pastoral, its dainty grace and tender
melancholy opened to me a new world of music.</p>

<p>I deserted the opera in favour of the Odéon, where I had the <i>entrée</i> to
the orchestra, and soon knew <i>Der Freyschütz</i> (according to Castilblaze)
by heart.</p>

<p>More than twenty years have passed since Weber himself passed through
Paris for the first and last time. He was on his way to his London
death-bed, and breathlessly I followed in his track, hoping and longing
to meet him face to face.</p>

<p>One morning Lesueur said:</p>

<p>“Why were you not here five minutes sooner? Weber has been playing our
French scores by heart to me.”</p>

<p>A few hours later in a music shop<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_48" id="page_48">{48}</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>“Whom do you think we had here just now? Why, Weber!”</p>

<p>At the Odéon people were saying:</p>

<p>“Weber has just gone by. He is up in one of the boxes.”</p>

<p>It was maddening&mdash;I, alone, never saw him. Unlike Shakespeare’s
apparitions, he was visible to all but one.</p>

<p>Too obscure to dare to write, without a friend who could introduce me,
he passed out of my world.</p>

<p>Ah, why do not the thrice-gifted ones of this world know of the
passionate love and devotion their works inspire! If they could but
divine the suppressed admiration of a few faithful hearts! Would they
not gladly gather these chosen disciples about them to become a bulwark
against the shafts of envy, hatred, malice, and luke-warm tolerance of
which a thoughtless world makes them the target!</p>

<p>Weber was justly angry when he found out how Castilblaze&mdash;veterinary
surgeon of music&mdash;had butchered his beautiful work, and he published a
complaint before leaving Paris. Castilblaze actually had the audacity to
play the injured innocent, and to say that it was entirely owing to his
adaptation that <i>Freyschütz</i> had succeeded at all!</p>

<p>The wretch!&mdash;--yet a poor sailor gets fifty lashes for the slightest
insubordination.</p>

<p>Exactly the same thing had been done a few years earlier with Mozart’s
<i>Magic Flute</i>. It had been botched into a ghastly <i>pot-pourri</i> by
Lachnith&mdash;whom I hereby pillory with Castilblaze&mdash;and given as the
<i>Mysteries of Isis</i>.</p>

<p>Thus mocked, travestied, deprived of a limb here, an eye there&mdash;twisted
and maimed&mdash;these two men of genius were introduced to the French
public.</p>

<p>How is it that they put up with these atrocities?</p>

<p>Mozart assassinated by Lachnith.</p>

<p>Weber by Castilblaze&mdash;who did the same for Gluck, Mozart, Rossini, and
Beethoven.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_49" id="page_49">{49}</a></span></p>

<p>Beethoven’s symphonies “corrected” by Fétis, by Kreutzer, and by
Habeneck (of this I have more to say).</p>

<p>Molière and Corneille chopped up by Théâtre Français demons.</p>

<p>Shakespeare “arranged” for performance in England by Colley Cibber! The
list is endless.</p>

<p>No, a thousand times no! No man living has a right to try and destroy
the individuality of another, to force him to adopt a style not his own,
and to give up his natural point of view. If a man be commonplace, let
him remain so; if he be great&mdash;a choice spirit set above his
fellows&mdash;then, in the name of all the gods, bow humbly before him, and
let him stand erect and alone in his glory.</p>

<p>I know that Garrick improved <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> by putting his
exquisite, pathetic ending in the place of Shakespeare’s; but who are
the miscreants who doctored <i>King Lear</i>, <i>Hamlet</i>, <i>The Tempest</i>,
<i>Richard the Third</i>?</p>

<p>That all comes from Garrick’s example. Every mean scribbler thinks he
can give points to Shakespeare.</p>

<p>But to go back to music. At the last sacred concerts, after Kreutzer had
experimentalised by making cuts in one Beethoven symphony, did not
Habeneck follow suit by dropping out several instruments in another, and
M. Costa, in London, try all sorts of weird conclusions with big drums,
ophicleides, and trombones in <i>Don Giovanni</i> and <i>Figaro</i>? Well! if
conductors lead the way, who can blame the small fry for following
after?</p>

<p>But is not this the ruin of Art? Ought not we, who love and honour her,
who are jealous for the prescriptive rights of human intellect, to hound
down and annihilate the transgressor; to cry aloud:</p>

<p>“Thy crime is ridiculous. Thy stupidity beneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_50" id="page_50">{50}</a></span> contempt. Despair and
die! Be thou contemned, be thou derided, be thou accursed! Despair and
die!!!”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My devotion to Gluck and Spontini at first somewhat blinded me to the
glories of Mozart. Not only had I a prejudice against Italian, both
language and singers, but in <i>Don Giovanni</i> the composer has written a
passage that I call simply criminal. Doña Anna bewails her fate in a
passage of heart-rending beauty and sorrow, then, right in the middle,
after <i>Forse un giorno</i> comes an impossible piece of buffoonery that I
would give my blood to wipe out.</p>

<p>This and other similar passages that I found in his compositions sent my
admiration for Mozart down below zero. I felt I could not trust his
dramatic instinct, and it was not until years later, when I found the
original score of the <i>Magic Flute</i> instead of its travesty, the
<i>Mysteries of Isis</i>, and made acquaintance with the marvellous beauty of
his quartettes and quintettes, and some of his sonatas, that this
Angelic Doctor took his due place in my mind.</p>

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI<br /><br />
<small>HENRIETTE</small></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">I cannot</span> go minutely into all the sorrowful details of the great drama
of my life, upon which the curtain rose about this time (1827).</p>

<p>An English company had come over to Paris to play Shakespeare, and at
their first performance&mdash;<i>Hamlet</i>&mdash;I saw in Ophelia the Henriette
Smithson who, five years later, became my wife. The impression made upon
my heart and mind by her marvellous genius was only equalled by the
agitation into which I was plunged by the poetry she so nobly
interpreted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_51" id="page_51">{51}</a></span></p>

<p>Shakespeare, coming upon me unawares, struck me down as with a
thunderbolt. His lightning spirit, descending upon me with transcendent
power from the starry heights, opened to me the highest heaven of Art,
lit up its deepest depths, and revealed the best and grandest and truest
that earth can shew.</p>

<p>I realised the paltry meanness of our French view of that mighty brain.
The scales fell from my eyes, I saw, felt, understood, lived; I arose
and walked!</p>

<p>But the shock was overwhelming, and it was long ere I recovered.
Intense, profound melancholy, combined with extreme nerve-exhaustion,
reduced me to a pitiable state of mind and body that only a great
physiologist could diagnose.</p>

<p>A martyr to insomnia, I lost all elasticity of brain, all concentration,
all taste for my best loved studies, and I wandered aimlessly about the
Paris streets and through the country round.<a name="FNanchor_3_4" id="FNanchor_3_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_4" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>By dint of overtiring my body, I managed, during this wretched time, to
get four spells of death-like sleep or torpor, and four only; one night
in a field near Ville-Juif, one day near Sceaux; a third in the snow by
the frozen Seine near Neuilly, and the last on a table in the Café
Cardinal, where I slept five hours, to the great fright of the waiters,
who dared not touch me lest I should be dead.</p>

<p>Returning one day from this dreary wandering in search of my lost soul,
I noticed Moore’s <i>Irish Melodies</i> open on the table at</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“When he who adores thee,”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="nind">and, catching up a pen, I wrote the music to that heart-rending farewell
straight off. It is the <i>Elégie</i> at the end of my set of songs called
<i>Ireland</i>. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_52" id="page_52">{52}</a></span> is the only time I can remember being able to depict a
sentiment while actively under its influence, and seldom have I gone so
direct to the heart of it.</p>

<p>It is a most difficult song both to sing and to accompany. To do it
justice the singer must create his own atmosphere, so must the pianist
and only the most sensitive and artistic souls should attempt it.</p>

<p>For this reason, during all the twenty odd years since it was written, I
have never asked anyone to try it; but one day Alizard picked it up and
began trying it without the piano. Even that upset me so terribly that I
had to beg him to stop. He understood. I know he would have interpreted
it perfectly, and it was more than I could bear. I did begin to set it
to an orchestral accompaniment, but I thought:</p>

<p>“No, this is not for the general public. I could not stand their calm
indifference,” and I burnt the score.</p>

<p>Yet some day it may chance, in England or Germany, to find a niche in
some wounded breast, some quivering soul&mdash;in France and Italy it is a
hopeless alien.</p>

<p>Coming away from <i>Hamlet</i>, I vowed that never more would I expose myself
to Shakespearian temptation, never more singe my scorched wings in his
flame.</p>

<p>Next morning <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> was placarded. In terror lest the free
list of the Odéon should be suspended by the new management, I tore
round to the box-office and bought a stall. I was done for!</p>

<p>Ah! what a change from the dull grey skies and icy winds of Denmark to
the burning sun, the perfumed nights of Italy! From the melancholy, the
cruel irony, the tears, the mourning, the lowering destiny of Hamlet,
what a transition to the impetuous youthful love, the long-drawn kisses,
the vengeance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_53" id="page_53">{53}</a></span> the despairing fatal conflict of love and death in those
hapless lovers!</p>

<p>By the third act, half suffocated by my emotion, with the grip of an
iron hand upon my heart, I cried to myself: “I am lost&mdash;am lost!”</p>

<p>Knowing no English I could but grope mistily through the fog of a
translation, could only see Shakespeare as in a glass&mdash;darkly. The
poetic weft that winds its golden thread in network through those
marvellous creations was invisible to me then; yet, as it was, how much
I learnt!</p>

<p>An English critic has stated in the <i>Illustrated London News</i> that, on
seeing Miss Smithson that night, I said:</p>

<p>“I will marry Juliet and will write my greatest symphony on the play.”</p>

<p>I did both, but I never said anything of the kind. I was in far too much
perturbation to entertain such ambitious dreams. Only through much
tribulation were both ends gained.</p>

<p>After seeing these two plays I had no more difficulty in keeping away
from the theatre. I shuddered at the bare idea of renewing such awful
suffering, and shrank as if from excruciating physical pain.</p>

<p>Months passed in this state of numb despair, my only lucid moments being
dreams of Shakespeare and of Miss Smithson&mdash;now the darling of
Paris&mdash;and dreary comparisons between her brilliant triumphs and my sad
obscurity.</p>

<p>As I gradually awoke to life again, a plan began to take shape in my
mind. She should hear of me; she should know that I also was an artist;
I would do what, so far, no French artist had ever done&mdash;give a concert
entirely of my own works. For this three things were needed&mdash;copies,
hall, and performers.</p>

<p>Therefore (this was early in the spring of 1828) I set to work, and,
writing sixteen hours out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_54" id="page_54">{54}</a></span> twenty-four, I copied every single part of
the pieces I had chosen, which were the overtures to <i>Waverley</i> and the
<i>Francs-Juges</i>, an aria and trio from the latter, the scena <i>Heroic
Greek</i>, and the cantata on the <i>Death of Orpheus</i>, that the
Conservatoire committee had judged unplayable.</p>

<p>While copying furiously I saved furiously too, and added some hundreds
of francs to my store, wherewith to pay the chorus; for orchestra I knew
I might count on the friendly help of the staff of the Odéon, with a
sprinkling of assistants from the Opera and the Nouveautés.</p>

<p>My chief difficulty was the hall; it always is in Paris. For the only
suitable one&mdash;the Conservatoire&mdash;I must have a permit from M. de
Larochefoucauld and also the consent of Cherubini.</p>

<p>The first was easily obtained; not so the second.</p>

<p>At the first mention of my design Cherubini flew in a rage.</p>

<p>“Vant to gif a conchert?” he said, with his usual suavity.</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“Must ’ave permission of Fine Arts Director first.”</p>

<p>“I have it.”</p>

<p>“M. de Larossefoucauld, ’e consent?”</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“But me, I not consent. I vill oppose zat you get ze ’all.”</p>

<p>“But, monsieur, you can have no reasonable objection, since the hall is
not engaged for the next fortnight.”</p>

<p>“But I tell to you zat I vill not ’ave zat you gif zis conchert.
Everyone is avay and no profit vill be to you.”</p>

<p>“I expect none. I merely wish to become known.”</p>

<p>“Zere is no necessity zat you become known.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_55" id="page_55">{55}</a></span> And zen for expense you
vill want monee. Vhat ’ave you of monee?”</p>

<p>“Sufficient, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“A-a-ah! But vhat vill you make ’ear at zis conchert?”</p>

<p>“Two overtures, some excerpts from an opera and the <i>Death of Orpheus</i>.”</p>

<p>“Zat competition cantata? I vill not ’ave zat! She is bad&mdash;bad; she is
impossible to play.”</p>

<p>“You say so, monsieur; I judge differently. That a bad pianist could not
play it is no reason that a good orchestra should not.”</p>

<p>“Zen it is for insult of ze Académie zat you play zis?”</p>

<p>“No, monsieur; it is simply as an experiment. If, as is possible, the
Academy was right in saying my score could not be played, then certainly
the orchestra will not play it. If the Academy was wrong, people will
only say that I made good use of its judgment and have corrected my
score.”</p>

<p>“You can only ’ave your conchert on ze Sunday.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I will take Sunday.”</p>

<p>“But zose poor <i>employés</i>&mdash;ze doorkeepers&mdash;zey ’ave but ze Sunday for
repose zem. Vould you take zeir only rest-day? Zey vill die&mdash;zose poor
folks&mdash;zey vill die of fatigue.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, monsieur. These poor folks are delighted at the chance
of earning a few extra francs, and they will not thank you for depriving
them of it.”</p>

<p>“I vill not ’ave it; I vill not! And I write to ze Director zat he
vizdraw permission.”</p>

<p>“Most hearty thanks, monsieur, but M. de Larochefoucauld never breaks
his word. I also shall write and retail our conversation exactly. Then
he will be able to weigh the arguments on both sides.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_56" id="page_56">{56}</a></span>”</p>

<p>I did so, and was afterwards told by one of his secretaries that my
dialogue-letter made the Director laugh till he cried. He was, above
all, touched at Cherubini’s tender consideration for those poor devils
of <i>employés</i> whom I was going to kill with fatigue.</p>

<p>He replied, as any man blessed with commonsense would, repeating his
authorisation and adding:</p>

<p>“You will kindly show this letter to M. Cherubini, who has already
received the necessary <i>orders</i>.”</p>

<p>Of course I posted off to the Conservatoire and handed in my letter;
Cherubini read it, turned pale, then yellow, and finally green, then
handed it back without a word.</p>

<p>This was my first Roland for the Oliver he gave me in turning me out of
the library. It was not to be my last.</p>

<h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>XII<br /><br />
<small>MY FIRST CONCERT</small></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Having</span> secured orchestra, hall, chorus and parts, I only wanted soloists
and a conductor. Bloc, of the Odéon, kindly accepted the latter post,
and Alexis Dupont, although very unwell, took under his wing my
<i>Orpheus</i>, which he had promised to sing before the jury of the
Institute, had it been passed.</p>

<p>But unluckily his hoarseness got so much worse that, when the day came,
he was unable to sing at all, so I was deprived of the wicked joy of
putting on the programme, “<i>Death of Orpheus</i>; lyric poem, judged
impossible of execution by the Académie des Beaux Arts, performed May
1828.”</p>

<p>A concert at which most of the executants helped for love and not for
money naturally came off poorly in rehearsals; still, at the final
rehearsal the overtures went fairly well, the <i>Francs-Juges</i> calling
forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_57" id="page_57">{57}</a></span> warm applause from the orchestra; the finale of the cantata being
even more successful.</p>

<p>In this, after the <i>Bacchanal</i>, I made the wind carry on the motif of
Orpheus’ love-song to a strange rushing undertone accompaniment by the
rest of the players, while the dying wail of a far-off voice cries:</p>

<p>“Eurydice! Eurydice! hapless Eurydice!”</p>

<p>The wild sadness of my music-picture affected the whole orchestra, and
they hailed it with wild enthusiasm. I am sorry now that I burnt it, it
was worth keeping for those last pages alone.</p>

<p>With the exception of the <i>Bacchanal</i>&mdash;the famous piece in which the
Conservatoire pianist got hung up&mdash;which was given with magnificent
verve, nothing else in the cantata went very well and, thanks to
Dupont’s illness, it was withdrawn. No doubt Cherubini preferred to say
that it was because the orchestra could not play it.</p>

<p>In this cantata I first noticed how impossible conductors, unused to
grand opera, find it to give way to the capricious and varied time of
the recitative. Bloc, only accustomed to songs interspersed with spoken
dialogue, was quite confused and, in some places, never got right at
all, which made a learned periwigged amateur, who was at rehearsal, say,
as he shook his head at me:</p>

<p>“Give me good old Italian cantatas! Now that’s the music that never
bothers a conductor. It plays itself, it runs alone.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said dryly, “just as old donkeys plod round and round their
treadmill.”</p>

<p>That is how I set about making friends.</p>

<p>Much against the grain I replaced <i>Orpheus</i> by the <i>Resurrexit</i> from my
mass, and finally the concert came off.</p>

<p>Duprez, with his sweet, weak voice, did well in the aria; the overtures
and <i>Resurrexit</i> were also a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_58" id="page_58">{58}</a></span> success, but the trio with chorus was a
regular failure.</p>

<p>Not only was the trio miserably sung, but the chorus missed its entry
and never came in at all!</p>

<p>I need hardly say that, after paying expenses, including the chorus that
held its tongue in such a masterly manner, I was completely cleaned out.</p>

<p>However, the concert was a most useful lesson to me.</p>

<p>Not only did I become known to artists and public, which (<i>pace</i>
Cherubini!) was a necessity, but, by doggedly facing the innumerable
difficulties of a composer, I gained most valuable experience.</p>

<p>Several of the papers praised me, and even Fétis&mdash;Fétis, who
afterwards<a name="FNanchor_4_5" id="FNanchor_4_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_5" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> ... spoke of me, in a drawing-room, as a coming man.</p>

<p>But what of Miss Smithson?</p>

<p>Alas! I found out that, absorbed in her own engrossing work, of me and
my concert she never heard a whisper!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<i>6th June 1828.</i>&mdash;Are you parched with anxiety
to know the result of my concert? I have only
waited in order to send you the papers too.
Triumphant success! After the applause at the
general rehearsals of Friday and Saturday I had no
more misgivings.</p>

<p>“Our beloved <i>Pastoral</i> was ruined by the chorus
that only found out it had not come in just as the
whole thing finished. But oh, the <i>Resurrexit</i>! and
oh, the applause! As soon as one round finished
another began until, being unable to stand it all, I
doubled up on the kettle-drum and cried hard.</p>

<p>“Why were you not there, dear friend, faithful
champion? I thought of and longed for you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_59" id="page_59">{59}</a></span></p>

<p>“At that wild trombone and ophicleide solo
in the <i>Francs-Juges</i>, one of the first violins
shouted:</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>The rainbow is the bow of your violin, the
winds play your organ and the seasons beat time!’</p>

<p>“Whereupon the whole orchestra started applauding
a thought of which they could not possibly
grasp the extent. The drummer by my side seized
my arm, ejaculating, ‘Superb&mdash;sublime,’ while I tore
my hair and longed to shriek:</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Monstrous! Gigantic! Horrible!’</p>

<p>“All the opera people were present, and there
was no end to the congratulations. The most pleased
were Habeneck, Dérivis, Dupont, Mademoiselle
Mori, Hérold, etc. Nothing was lacking to my
success&mdash;not even the criticisms of Panseron and
Brugnières, who say my style is new and bad, and
that such writing is not to be encouraged.</p>

<p>“My dear, dear fellow! in pity send me an
opera. How can I write without a book? For
heaven’s sake finish something!”</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<i>June.</i>&mdash;All day long I have been tearing about
the country, leagues upon leagues, and I still live.
I feel so lonely! Send me something to work at,
some bone to gnaw! The country was lovely; the
people all looked happy. In the flooding light the
trees rustled softly; but, oh! I was alone&mdash;all alone
in that wide plain. Space, time, oblivion, pain and
rage held me in their terrific grasp. Struggle wildly
as I might, life seemed to escape me; I held but a
few pitiful fragments in my trembling hands.</p>

<p>“Oh! the horror, at my age and with my temperament,
to have these harrowing delusions, and, with
them, the miserable persecutions of my family! My
father has again stopped my allowance; my sister
writes to-day that he is immovable. Oh, for money!
money! Money <i>does</i> bring happiness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_60" id="page_60">{60}</a></span></p>

<p>“Still ... my heart beats as if with joy, the blood
courses through my veins.</p>

<p>“Bah! I am all right. Joy, hang it! I will have
joy!”</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
“<i>Sunday morning.</i><br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;Do not worry over my aberrations&mdash;the crisis is past. I
cannot explain in a letter, which might go astray; but I beg you will
not breathe a word of my state of mind to anyone, it might get round to
my father and distress him. All that I can do is suffer in silence until
time changes my fate.</p>

<p>“Yesterday’s wild excursion did for me entirely. I can hardly
move.&mdash;<i>Adieu.</i>”</p></div>

<p>In an artist’s life sometimes wild tempests succeed each other with
bewildering rapidity, and so it was with me about this time.</p>

<p>Hardly had I recovered from the successive shocks of Weber and
Shakespeare, when above my horizon burst the sun of glorious Beethoven
to melt for me that misty inmost veil of the holiest shrine in music, as
Shakespeare had lifted that of poetry.</p>

<p>To Habeneck, with all his shortcomings, is due the credit of introducing
the master he adored to Paris. In order to found the Conservatoire
concerts, now of world-wide fame, he had to face opposition, abuse and
irony, and to inspire with his own ardour a set of men who, not being
Beethoven enthusiasts, did not see the force of slaving for poor pay at
music that, to them, appeared simply eccentric.</p>

<p>Oh! the nonsense I have heard them airing on those miracles of
inspiration and learning&mdash;the symphonies!</p>

<p>Even Lesueur&mdash;honest, but devoted to antiquated dogmas&mdash;stood aside with
Cherubini, Päer, Kreutzer<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_61" id="page_61">{61}</a></span> and Catel, until, one day, I swept him off to
hear the great C minor symphony.</p>

<p>I told him it was his duty to know and appreciate personally such a
notable fact as this revelation of a new and glorious style to us, the
children of the old classicism.</p>

<p>Conscientiously anxious to judge fairly, he would not have me by to
distract him, but shut himself up with strangers at the back of a box.</p>

<p>The symphony over, I hurried round to hear his verdict, and found him,
with flushed face, striding up and down a passage.</p>

<p>“Ouf!” he cried, “let me get out; I must have air! It’s incredible!
Marvellous! It has so upset and bewildered me, that when I wanted to put
on my hat I <i>couldn’t find my head</i>. Let me go by myself. I will see you
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>I felt triumphant, and took care to go round next day. We spoke of
nothing but the masterpiece we had heard; yet he seemed to reply to my
ravings rather constrainedly. Still I persevered, until, after dragging
out of him another acknowledgment of his heart-felt appreciation, he
ended, with a curious smile:</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s all very well; but such music ought not to be written.”</p>

<p>“No fear, dear master,” I retorted; “there will never be too much of
it!”</p>

<p>Poor human nature! Poor master! How much regret, envy,
narrow-mindedness; what a dread of the unknown and confession of
incapacity lay beneath your words! “Such music should not be written,”
because the speaker knows instinctively that he himself could never
write it.</p>

<p>Thus do all great men suffer from their contemporaries.</p>

<p>Haydn said much the same of Beethoven, whom he called a <i>great
pianist</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_62" id="page_62">{62}</a></span></p>

<p>Grétry of Mozart, who, he said, had put the statue in the orchestra and
the pedestal on the stage.</p>

<p>Handel, who said his cook was more of a musician than Gluck.</p>

<p>Rossini, who vowed that Weber’s music gave him a stomach-ache.</p>

<p>But the antipathy of the two latter to Gluck and Weber I believe to be
due to quite another reason&mdash;a natural inability in these two
comfortable portly gentlemen to understand the point of view of the two
men of heart and sensibility.</p>

<p>This deliberately obstinate attitude of Lesueur towards Beethoven opened
my eyes to the utter worthlessness of his conservative tenets, and from
that moment I left the broad, smooth road wherein he had guided my
footsteps, for a hard and thorny way over hedges and ditches, hills and
valleys. But I could not hurt the old man by my apostasy, so did my best
to dissimulate my change of mind, and he only found it out long after,
on hearing a composition I had never shewn him.</p>

<p>It was just at this time that I set out on my treadmill round as critic
for the papers.</p>

<p>Ferrand, Cazalès and de Carné&mdash;well-known political names&mdash;agreed to
start a periodical to air their views, which they called <i>Révue
Européenne</i>, and Ferrand suggested that I should undertake the musical
correspondence.</p>

<p>“But I can’t write,” I objected; “my prose is simply detestable. And,
besides&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, it is not,” said Ferrand; “have I not got your letters? You will
soon be knocked into shape. Besides, we shall revise what you write
before it is printed. Come along to de Carné and hear all about it.”</p>

<p>What a weapon this writing for the press would be wherewith to defend
truth and beauty in art!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_63" id="page_63">{63}</a></span> So, ignorant of the web of fate I was throwing
around my own shoulders, I smiled innocently and walked straight into
the meshes.</p>

<p>I was likely to be diffident of my writing powers, for, once before,
being furious at the attacks made upon Gluck by the Rossini faction, I
asked M. Michaud, of the <i>Quotidienne</i>, to let me reply. He consented,
and I said to myself, gaily:</p>

<p>“Now, you brutes, I have got you; I’ll smite you hip and thigh!”</p>

<p>But I smote no one and nothing.</p>

<p>My utter ignorance of journalism, of the ways of the world, of press
etiquette and my untamed musical passions, landed me in a regular bog.
My article went far beyond the bounds of newspaper warfare, and M.
Michaud’s hair stood on end.</p>

<p>“But, my dear fellow, you know, I cannot possibly publish a thing like
that. You are pulling people’s houses down about their ears. Take it
back and whittle it down a bit.”</p>

<p>But I was too lazy and too disgusted, so there it ended.</p>

<p>This laziness of mine does not apply to composition, which comes
naturally to me. Hour after hour I labour at a score, sometimes for
eight hours at a time; no work is too minute, no pains too great.</p>

<p>Prose, however, is always a burden. Sometimes I go back eight or ten
times to an article for the <i>Journal des Débats</i>; even a subject I like
takes me at least two days. And what blots, what scrawls, what erasures!
My first copy is a sight to behold.</p>

<p>Propped up by Ferrand, I wrote for the <i>Révue Européenne</i> appreciative
articles on Beethoven, Gluck and Spontini that made a certain mark, and
thus began my apprenticeship to the difficult and dangerous work that
has taken such a fatal hold on my life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_64" id="page_64">{64}</a></span></p>

<p>Never since have I shaken myself free, and strangely diversified have
been its influences on my career both in France and abroad.</p>

<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>XIII<br /><br />
<small>AN ACADEMY EXAMINATION</small></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Torn</span> by my Shakespearian love, which seemed intensified instead of
diverted by the influence of Beethoven; dreamy, unsociable, taciturn to
the verge of moroseness, untidy in dress, unbearable alike to myself and
my friends, I dragged on until June 1828 when, for the third time, I
tempted fate at the Institute and won a second prize.</p>

<p>This was a gold medal of small value, but it carried with it a free pass
to all the lyric theatres, and a fair prospect of the first prize the
following year.</p>

<p>The Prix de Rome was much better worth having. It insured three thousand
francs a year for five years, of which the two first must be spent in
Italy, and the third in Germany. The remaining two might be passed in
Paris, after which the winner was left to sink or swim at his own sweet
will.</p>

<p>This is how the affair was worked until 1865, when the Emperor revised
the statutes. I shall hardly be believed, but, since I won both prizes,
I only state what I know to be absolutely true.</p>

<p>The competition was open to any Frenchman under thirty, who must go
through the preliminary examination, which weeded out all but the most
promising half dozen.</p>

<p>The subject set is always a lyric scena, and by way of finding out
whether the candidates have melody, dramatic force, instrumentation, and
other knowledge necessary for writing such a scena, they are set down to
compose a <i>vocal fugue</i>! <i>Each fugue must be signed.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_65" id="page_65">{65}</a></span></p>

<p>Next day the musical section of the Academy sits in judgment on the
fugues, and, since some of the signatures are those of the Academicians’
pupils, this performance is not entirely free from the charge of
partiality.</p>

<p>The successful competitors then have dictated to them the classical poem
on which they are to work. It always begins this way:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“And now the rosy-fingered dawn;”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">or,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“And now with lustre soft the horizon glows;”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">or,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“And now fair Phœbus’ shining car draws near;”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">or,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“And now with purple pomp the mountains decked.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Armed with this inspiring effusion the young people are locked up in
their little cells with pens, paper, and piano until their work is done.</p>

<p>Twice a day they are let out to feed, but they may not leave the
Institute building. Everything brought in for their use is carefully
searched lest outside help should be given, yet every day, from six to
eight, they may have visitors and invite their friends to jovial
dinners, at which any amount of assistance&mdash;verbal or written&mdash;might be
given.</p>

<p>This lasts for twenty-two days, but anyone who has finished sooner is at
liberty to go, leaving his manuscript&mdash;<i>signed as before</i>&mdash;with the
secretary.</p>

<p>Then the grave and reverend signors of the jury assemble, having added
to their number two members of any other section of the
Institute&mdash;either engravers, painters, sculptors or
architects&mdash;anything, in short, but musicians.</p>

<p>You see, they are so thoroughly competent to judge an art of which they
know nothing.</p>

<p>There they sit and solemnly listen to these scenas boiled down on a
piano. How <i>could</i> anyone profess<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_66" id="page_66">{66}</a></span> to judge an orchestral work like
that? It might do for simple old-fashioned music, but nothing
modern&mdash;that is, if the composer knows how to marshal the forces at his
command&mdash;could by any possibility be rendered on the piano.</p>

<p>Try the Communion March from Cherubini’s great Mass. What becomes of
those long-drawn, mystical wind-notes that fill one’s soul with
religious ecstasy; of those exquisitely interwoven flutes and clarinets
to which the whole effect is due?</p>

<p>They have completely vanished, since the piano can neither hold nor
inflate a sound.</p>

<p>Does it not follow, then, that the piano, by reducing every
tone-character to one dead level, becomes a guillotine whereby the
noblest heads are laid low and mediocrity alone survives?</p>

<p>Well! After this precious performance the prize is awarded, and you
conclude that this is the end of it all?</p>

<p>Not a bit! A week later the whole thirty-five Academicians, painters and
architects and sculptors and engravers on copper and engravers of medals
all turn up to give the final verdict.</p>

<p>They do not shut out the six musicians, although they are going to judge
music.</p>

<p>Again the pianists and the singers go through the compositions, then
round goes the fatal urn, in order that the judgment of the previous
week may be confirmed, modified, or reversed.</p>

<p>Justice compels me to add that the musicians return the compliment by
going to judge the other arts, of which they are as blindly ignorant as
are their colleagues of music.</p>

<p>On the day of the distribution of prizes the chosen cantata is performed
by a full orchestra. It seems just a little late; it might have been
more serviceable to get the orchestra before judgment&mdash;seeing that after
this there is no repeal&mdash;but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_67" id="page_67">{67}</a></span> Academy is inquisitive; it really does
wish to know something about the work it has crowned. Laudable
curiosity!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In my time there was an old doorkeeper at the Institute whose
indignation at all this procedure was most amusing. It was his duty to
lock us up and let us out, and, being also usher to the Academicians, he
was on the inside track and made some very odd notes.</p>

<p>He had been a cabin boy, which at once enlisted my sympathies; for I
always loved sailors, and can listen imperturbably to their long-winded
yarns; no matter how far they wander from the point I am always ready
with a word to set them right again.</p>

<p>We were the best of friends, Pingard and I. One day, talking of Syria,
he mentioned Volney.</p>

<p>“M. le Comte,” he said, “was so good and easy-going that he always wore
blue woollen stockings.”</p>

<p>But his respect for me became unbounded enthusiasm when I asked whether
he knew Levaillant.</p>

<p>“M. Levaillant!” he cried, “Rather! One day at the Cape I was sauntering
along, whistling, when a big sun-burnt man with a beard turned round on
me. I suppose he guessed I was French from my whistle. Of course I
whistle in French, monsieur.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>I say, you young rogue, you’re French?’</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>I should say I was. Givet is my part of the country.’</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Oh, you <i>are</i> French?’</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Yes.’</p>

<p>“And he turned his back and strode off. You see I did know M.
Levaillant!”</p>

<p>The good old boy made such a friend of me that he told me a lot he would
not have dared to repeat to anyone else.</p>

<p>I remember a lively conversation with him the day I got the second
prize.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_68" id="page_68">{68}</a></span></p>

<p>We had a piece of Tasso set that year, towards the end of which the
Queen of Antioch invokes the god of the Christians she has contemned. I
had the impudence to think that, although the last section was marked
<i>agitato</i>, this ought to be a prayer, and I wrote it <i>andante</i>. I was
rather pleased with it on the whole.</p>

<p>When I got to the Institute to hear whether the painters and sculptors,
and architects, and engravers of medals, and line-engravers had settled
whether I were a good or bad musician, I ran against Pingard on the
stairs.</p>

<p>“Well?” I asked, “what have they decided?”</p>

<p>“Oh, hallo, Berlioz! I am glad you have come. I was hunting for you.”</p>

<p>“What have I got? Do hurry up! First? Second? Nothing?”</p>

<p>“Oh, do wait; I’m all of a tremble. Will you believe you were only two
votes short of the first prize?”</p>

<p>“The first I’ve heard of it.”</p>

<p>“It’s true, though. The second is all very well, but I call it beastly
that you missed the first by two votes. I am neither a painter, nor a
sculptor, nor an architect, so of course I know nothing about music, but
I’ll be hanged if that <i>God of the Christians</i> of yours didn’t set my
heart gurgling and rumbling to such a tune that if I had met you that
minute I should have&mdash;have&mdash;stood you a drink!”</p>

<p>“Thanks awfully, Pingard. I admire your taste. But, I say&mdash;you have been
on the Coromandel coast?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. Why?”</p>

<p>“To Java?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sumatra?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Borneo?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_69" id="page_69">{69}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You are a friend of Levaillant?”</p>

<p>“I should think so. Hand in glove with him.”</p>

<p>“You know Volney?”</p>

<p>“The good Count with the blue woollen stockings? Certainly.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then, you <i>must</i> be a splendid judge of music.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;why? How?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know exactly how or why. But it seems to me that your
title is just as good as that of the gentlemen who do judge. Tell me,
though, what happened.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my goodness! It’s always the same old game. If I had thirty
children, devil take me if one of them should be an artist of any sort.
You see, I am on the inside track, and know how they sell their votes.
It’s nothing but a blessed old shop. See here! Once I heard M. Lethière
asking M. Cherubini for his vote for a pupil.”</p>

<p>“Don’t refuse, my dear fellow,” he said, “we are such old friends, and
my pupil really has talent.”</p>

<p>“No, he shall not have my vote,” Cherubini answered. “He promised my
wife an album of drawings that she wanted badly. He hasn’t even done her
a single tree!”</p>

<p>“That’s rather too bad of you,” said M. Lethière. “I vote for your
people, and you might vote for mine. Look here! I’ll do you the album
myself. I can’t say more than that.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that’s another pair of boots. What is your pupil’s name and
picture? I must not get muddled. Pingard, a pencil and paper!”</p>

<p>“They went off into the window corner and wrote something, then I heard
the musician say&mdash;</p>

<p>“All right, I will vote for him.”</p>

<p>“Now, isn’t that disgusting? If I had had a son in the competition and
they had played him a trick<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_70" id="page_70">{70}</a></span> like that, wouldn’t it have been enough to
make me chuck myself out of window?”</p>

<p>“Come, Pingard, calm down a bit and tell me about to-day.”</p>

<p>“Well, when M. Dupont had finished singing your cantata they began
writing their verdicts, and I brought the hurn” (Pingard always would
stick in that “h”). “There was a musician close by whispering to an
architect, ‘Don’t give him your vote; he’s no good at all, and never
will be. He is gone on that eccentric creature Beethoven, and we shall
never get him right again.’ ‘Really!’ said the architect. ‘Yet&mdash;’ ‘Well,
ask Cherubini. You will take his word, won’t you? He will tell you that
Beethoven has turned the fellow’s head&mdash;’ I beg pardon,” said Pingard,
breaking off his story, “but who is this M. Beethoven? He doesn’t belong
to the Academy, and yet everyone seems to be talking of him.”</p>

<p>“No, no! He’s a German. Go on.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t much more. When I passed the hurn to the architect I saw
that he gave his vote to No. 4 instead of to you. Suddenly one of the
musicians said, ‘Gentlemen, I think you ought to know that, in the
second part of the score we have just heard, there is an exceedingly
clever and effective piece of orchestration to which the piano cannot do
justice. This ought to be taken into consideration.’ ‘Don’t tell us a
cock-and-bull story like that,’ cried another musician. ‘Your pupil has
broken the rules and written two quick arias instead of one, and he has
put in an extra prayer. We cannot allow rules to be set at nought like
this; it would be establishing a precedent.’ ‘Oh, this is too
ridiculous! What says the secretary?’ ‘I think that we might pardon a
<i>certain</i> amount of licence, and that the jury should distinctly
understand that passage that you say cannot be properly<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_71" id="page_71">{71}</a></span> given by the
piano.’ ‘No, no!’ cried Cherubini, ‘it’s all nonsense. There is no such
clever piece of work. It is a regular jumble, and would be abominable
for the orchestra.’</p>

<p>“Then on all sides rose the architects, painters, sculptors, etc.,
saying, ‘Gentlemen, for pity’s sake agree somehow! We can only judge by
what we hear, and if you will not agree&mdash;’ And all began to talk at
once, and it became distinctly a bore, so M. Régnault and two others
marched out without voting. They counted the votes. You only got second
prize.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Pingard, but, I say&mdash;they manage things better at the Cape
Academy, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“The Cape? Why, you know they have not got one. Fancy a Hottentot
Academy!”</p>

<p>“Well then, Coromandel?”</p>

<p>“None there.”</p>

<p>“Java?”</p>

<p>“None either.”</p>

<p>“What, no Academy at all in the East? Poor Orientals!”</p>

<p>“They manage to get along pretty well without.”</p>

<p>“What outer barbarians!”</p>

<p>I bade the old usher good-bye, thinking what a blessing it would be if I
could send the Academy to civilise Borneo.</p>

<p>Two years later the Prix de Rome was mine, but poor old Pingard was
dead. It was a pity.</p>

<p>If he had heard my “Burning of the Palace of Sardanapalus” he might have
stood me ... two drinks!</p>

<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV<br /><br />
<small>FAUST&mdash;CLEOPATRA</small></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Again</span> I relapsed into my habitual gloom and indolence. Like a dead
invisible planet I circled round<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_72" id="page_72">{72}</a></span> that radiant sun that alas! was doomed
so soon to fade into mournful oblivion.</p>

<p>Estelle, star of my dawn, was eclipsed and lost in the noontide
brilliance of her mighty rival&mdash;my overwhelming and glorious love.</p>

<p>Although I took care never to pass the theatre, never willingly to look
at Othelia’s portraits in the shop windows, yet still I wrote&mdash;receiving
never a sign in reply. My first letters frightened her, and she bade her
maid take her no more.</p>

<p>The company was going to Holland, and its last nights were advertised.
Still I kept away; to see her again was more than I could bear.</p>

<p>However, hearing that she was to act two scenes from <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>
with Abbott, for the benefit of Huet, the actor, I had a sudden fancy to
see my own name on a placard beside that of the great actress.</p>

<p>I <i>might</i> be successful under her very eyes!</p>

<p>Full of this childish notion I got permission from the manager and
conductor of the Opéra Comique to add an overture of my own to the
programme.</p>

<p>On going to rehearsal I found the English company just finishing;
broken-hearted Romeo held Juliet in his arms. At sight of the group I
gave a hoarse, despairing cry and wringing my hands wildly, I fled from
the theatre. Juliet saw and heard me; terror-stricken she pointed me out
to those around, begging them to <i>beware of the gentleman with the wild
eyes</i>.</p>

<p>An hour later I went back to an empty theatre. The orchestra assembled
and my overture was run through&mdash;like a sleep walker I listened, hearing
nothing&mdash;when the performers applauded me I wondered vaguely whether
Miss Smithson would like it too! Fool that I was!!</p>

<p>It seems impossible that I could, even then, have been so ignorant of
the world as not to know that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_73" id="page_73">{73}</a></span> be the overture what it may, at a
benefit, no one in the audience listens. Still less the actors, who only
arrive in time for their turns and trouble themselves not at all about
the music.</p>

<p>My overture was well played, fairly received&mdash;but not encored&mdash;Miss
Smithson heard nothing of it and left next day for Holland.</p>

<p>By a strange chance (I could never get her to believe it <i>was</i> chance) I
had taken lodgings at 96 Rue de Richelieu, opposite her house. Worn out,
half dead, I lay upon my bed until three the next afternoon; then,
rising, I crawled wearily to the window.</p>

<p>Cruel Fate! At that very minute she came out and stepped into her
carriage <i>en route</i> for Amsterdam.</p>

<p>Was ever misery like mine?</p>

<p>Oh God! my deadly, awful loneliness; my bleeding heart! Could I bear
that leaden weight of anguish, that empty world; that hatred of life;
that shuddering shrinking from impossible death?</p>

<p>Even Shakespeare has not described it; he simply counts it, in <i>Hamlet</i>,
the cruellest burden left in life.</p>

<p>Could I bear more?</p>

<p>I ceased to write; my brain grew numb as my suffering increased. One
power alone was left me&mdash;to suffer.</p>

<p>Another landmark in my life was the reading of Goethe’s <i>Faust</i>; I could
not lay it down, but read and read and read&mdash;at table, in the streets,
in the theatres.</p>

<p>Although a prose translation, songs and rhymed pieces were scattered
throughout, and these I set to music, then, without having heard a note
of them, was crazy enough to have them engraved. A few copies, under the
title of <i>Eight Scenes from Faust</i> were sold in Paris, and one fell into
the hands of M. Marx, the great Berlin critic, who wrote most kindly to
me about it. This unexpected encouragement from such a source gave me
real pleasure, particularly as the writer did not dwell too much on my
many and great faults. I know some of the ideas were good, since I
afterwards used them for the <i>Damnation de Faust</i>, but I know, also, how
hopelessly crude and badly written they were. As soon as I realised
this, I collected and burnt all the copies I could lay hands on.</p>

<p>Under Goethe’s influence I wrote my <i>Symphonie Fantastique</i>&mdash;very slowly
and laboriously in some parts, incredibly quickly and easily in others.
The <i>Scène aux Champs</i> worried me for three weeks, over and over again I
gave it up, but the <i>Marche au Supplice</i> was dashed off in a single
night. Of course they were afterwards touched and retouched.</p>

<p>Bloc, being anxious that my new symphony should be heard, suggested that
I should be allowed to give a concert at the Théâtre des Nouveautés.</p>

<p>The directors, attracted by the eccentricity of my work, agreed, and I
invited eighty performers to help, in addition to Bloc’s orchestra. On
my making enquiries about accommodation for such an army of executants
the manager replied, with the calm assurance of ignorance:</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right. Our property man knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_76" id="page_76">{76}</a></span> his business.” The day of
rehearsal arrived, and so did my hundred and thirty musicians&mdash;with
nowhere to put them!</p>

<p>I just managed to squeeze the violins into the orchestra, and then arose
an uproar that would have driven a calmer man than myself out of his
senses. Cries for chairs, desks, candles, strings, room for the drums,
etc., etc. Scene shifters tore up and down improvising desks and seats,
Bloc and I worked like sixty&mdash;but it was all useless; a regular rout; a
passage of the Bérésina.</p>

<p>However Bloc insisted on trying two movements to give the directors some
idea of the whole. So, all in a muddle, we struggled through the <i>Ball
Scene</i> and the <i>Marche au Supplice</i>, the latter calling forth frantic
applause.</p>

<p>But my concert never came off. The directors said that “they had no idea
so many arrangements were necessary for a symphony.” Thus my hopes were
dashed, and all for want of a few desks. Since then I always look into
the smallest details for myself.</p>

<p>Wishing to console me for this disappointment, Girard, conductor of the
Théâtre Italien, asked me to write something shorter than my unlucky
symphony, that he could have carefully performed at his theatre.</p>

<p>I therefore wrote a dramatic fantasia with choruses on the <i>Tempest</i>,
but no sooner did he see it than he said:</p>

<p>“This is too big for us; it must go to the opera.”</p>

<p>Without loss of time I interviewed M. Lubbert, director of the Royal
Academy. To my relief and delight, he at once agreed to have it played
at a concert for the Artists’ Benevolent Fund that was to take place
shortly. My name was known to him through my Conservatoire concert, and
he had seen notices of me in the papers. He, therefore, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_77" id="page_77">{77}</a></span>lieved in me,
put me through no humiliating examination, gave me his word, and kept it
religiously.</p>

<div class="poetry">

<span class="i0">“He was a man, Horatio.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>All went splendidly at rehearsal; Fétis did his best for me, and
everything seemed to smile, when, with my usual luck, an hour before the
concert there broke over Paris the worst storm that had been known for
fifty years. The streets were flooded and practically impassable, and
during the first half of the concert, when my <i>Tempest</i>&mdash;damned
tempest!&mdash;was being played, there were not more than three hundred
people in the place.</p>

<p class="c">
<i>Extracts from Letters to</i> <span class="smcap">H. Ferrand</span>.<br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<i>April 1829.</i>&mdash;Here is <i>Faust</i>, dear friend. Could you, without
stinting yourself, lend me another hundred francs to pay the
printer? I would rather borrow from you than from anyone else; yet
had you not offered, I should not have dared to ask. Your opera
(<i>Franc-Juges</i>) is splendid. You are indeed a poet! That finale of
the Bohemians at the end of the first act is a master stroke. I do
not believe anything so original has ever been done in a libretto
before. And I repeat, it is magnificent.”</p>

<p>“<i>June.</i>&mdash;No word from you for three months. Why is it? Does your
father suppress our letters, or can it be that you, at last,
believe the slanders you hear of me?</p>

<p>“I got a pupil, so have managed to pay the printer.</p>

<p>“I am very happy, life is charming&mdash;no pain, no despair, plenty of
day dreams; to crown all, the <i>Francs-Juges</i> has been refused by
the Opera Committee! They find it long and obscure, only the
Bohemian scene pleases them; but Duval thinks it remarkable and
says there is a future for it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_78" id="page_78">{78}</a></span></p>

<p>“I am going to make an opera like <i>Freyschütz</i> of it, and if I win
the prize perhaps Spohr (who is not jealous, but is most helpful to
young musicians) will let me try it at Cassel.</p>

<p>“No word have I had from you since I spoke of my hopeless love.
Nothing more has happened. This passion will be my death; how often
one hears that hope alone keeps love alive&mdash;am I not a living proof
of the contrary?</p>

<p>“All the English papers ring with her praises; I am unknown! When I
have written something great, something stupendous, I must go to
London to have it performed. Oh for success!&mdash;success under her
very eyes.</p>

<p>“I am writing a life of Beethoven for the <i>Correspondant</i>, and
cannot find a minute for composition&mdash;the rest of my time I copy
out parts. What a life!”</p></div>

<p>Once more came June, and with it my third attempt on the Prix de Rome.
This time I really did hope, for not only had I gained a second prize,
but I heard that the musical judges thought well of me.</p>

<p>Being over-confident I reasoned (falsely, as it turned out), “Since they
have decided to give me the prize, I need not bother to write exactly in
the style that suits them; I will compose a really artistic cantata.”</p>

<p>The subject was Cleopatra after Actium. Dying in convulsions, she
invokes the spirits of the Pharaohs, demanding&mdash;criminal though she
be&mdash;whether she dare claim a place beside them in their mighty tombs. It
was a magnificent theme, and I had often pondered over Juliet’s&mdash;</p>

appeal of the Egyptian Queen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_79" id="page_79">{79}</a></span></p>

<p>I was fool enough to head my score with those very words&mdash;the
unpardonable sin to my Voltairean judges&mdash;and wrote what seemed to me a
weird and dramatic piece, well suited to the words. I afterwards used
it, unchanged, for the <i>Chorus of Shades</i> in <i>Lelio</i>; I think it
deserved the prize. But it did not get it. None of the compositions did.
Rather than give it to a “young composer of such revolutionary
tendencies” they withheld it altogether.</p>

<p>Next day I met Boïeldieu, who, on seeing me, said:</p>

<p>“My dear boy, what on earth possessed you? The prize was in your hand,
and you simply threw it away.”</p>

<p>“But, monsieur, I really did my best.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it! Your <i>best</i> is the opposite of your <i>good</i>. How could I
possibly approve? I, who like nice gentle music&mdash;cradle-music, one might
say.”</p>

<p>“But, monsieur, could an Egyptian queen, passionate, remorseful, and
despairing, die in mortal anguish of body and soul to the sound of
cradle-music?”</p>

<p>“Oh, come! come! I know you have plenty of excuses, but they go for
nothing. You might at least have written gracefully.”</p>

<p>“Gladiators could die gracefully, but not Cleopatra. She had not to die
in public.”</p>

<p>“There! you <i>will</i> exaggerate so! No one expects her to dance a
quadrille. Why need you introduce such odd, queer harmonies into that
invocation? I am not well up in harmony, and I must own that those
outlandish chords of yours are beyond me.”</p>

<p>I bit my lip, not daring to make the obvious reply:</p>

<p>“Is it my fault that you know no harmony?”</p>

<p>“And then,” he went on, “why do you introduce a totally new rhythm in
your accompaniments? I never heard anything like it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_80" id="page_80">{80}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“I did not understand, monsieur, that we were not to try new modes if we
were fortunate enough to find the right place for them.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear good fellow, Madame Dabadie is a capital musician, yet one
could see it took all her care and talent to get her through.”</p>

<p>“Really, monsieur, I have yet to learn that music can be sung without
either talent or care.”</p>

<p>“Well, well! you will have the last word. But do be warned for next
year. Come and see me and we will talk it over like <i>French gentlemen</i>.”</p>

<p>And, chuckling over the point he had made (for his last words were a
quotation from his own <i>Jean de Paris</i>), he walked off.</p>

<p>Yes, Boïeldieu was right. The Parisians liked soothing music, even for
the most dramatic and harrowing situations. Pretty, innocent,
gentlemanly music, pleasant and making no demand upon one’s deepest
feelings.</p>

<p>Later on they wanted something different, and now they do not know what
they want, or rather they want nothing at all. Ah me! what was the good
God thinking of when He dropped me down in this pleasant land of France?</p>

<p>Yet I love her whenever I can forget her idiotic politics. How gay she
is, how dainty in wit, how bright in retort&mdash;how she boasts and swaggers
and humbugs, royally and republicanly! I am not sure, though, that this
last <i>is</i> amusing.</p>

<p>“Woe upon her! Could she but dream of the poetry, the infinite
bliss of such love as mine, she would fly to my arms, even though
my embrace should be her death.</p>

<p>“I was just going to begin my great symphony (<i>Episode in an
Artist’s Life</i>) to depict the course of this infernal love of
mine&mdash;but I can write nothing.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“<i>May.</i>&mdash;Your letter comforts me, dear friend, how good it is to be
blessed with a friend such as you! A man of heart, of soul, of
imagination! How rare that kindred spirits such as ours should meet
and sympathise.</p>

<p>“Words fail to tell the joy your affection gives me. You need not
fear for me with Henriette Smithson. I am no longer in danger in
that quarter; I pity and despise her. She is nothing but a
commonplace woman with an instinct for expressing the tortures of
the soul that she has never felt; she is quite incapable of
appreciating the noble, all-devouring love with which I honoured
her.</p>

<p>“The rehearsals of my symphony begin in three days; all the parts
are copied&mdash;there are two thousand three hundred pages. I hope to
goodness we shall have good receipts to pay for it all. The concert
takes place on the 30th May. And you alone will not be there! Even
my father wishes to come. Ah, my symphony!</p>

<p>“I wish the theatre people would somehow plot<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_85" id="page_85">{85}</a></span> to get <i>her</i>
there&mdash;that wretched woman! But she certainly would not go if she
read my programme. She could not but recognise herself. What will
people say? My story is so well known.”</p></div>

<p>At this time a new influence came into my life which, for a time,
eclipsed my Shakespearian passion.</p>

<p>Hiller, the German composer-pianist, whom I had known intimately ever
since his arrival in Paris, fell violently in love with Marie Moke, a
beautiful and talented girl, who, later on, became one of our greatest
pianists.</p>

<p>Her interest in me was aroused by Hiller’s account of my mental
sufferings, and&mdash;so Fate willed&mdash;we were thrown much together at a
boarding-school where we both gave lessons&mdash;she on the piano and I
on&mdash;the guitar! Odd though it be, I still figure in the prospectus of
Madame d’Aubré as professor of that noble instrument.</p>

<p>Meeting Mademoiselle Moke constantly, her dainty beauty and bewitching
mockery of my high-tragedy airs and dismal visage soon turned my
thoughts from my absorbing passion and won her a shrine in my heart. She
was but eighteen!</p>

<p>Hiller, poor fellow, behaved admirably. He recognised that it was Fate,
not treachery on my part and, heart-broken as he was, he wished me every
happiness and left for Frankfort.</p>

<p>This is all I need say of this violent interlude that, by stirring my
senses, turned me aside for a while from the mighty love that really
held my heart. In my Italian journey I will tell of the dramatic sequel.
Mademoiselle Moke nearly proved the proverb that it is not well to play
with fire!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1830 the Competition took place later than usual&mdash;on the 15th July.
For the fifth time I went up, firmly resolved, if I should fail, to go
no more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_86" id="page_86">{86}</a></span></p>

<p>As I finished my cantata the Revolution broke out and the Institute was
a curious sight. Grape shot rattled on the barred doors, cannon balls
shook the façade, women screamed and, in the momentary pauses, the
interrupted swallows took up their sweet, shrill cry. I hurried over the
last pages of my cantata, and on the 29th was free to maraud about the
streets, pistol in hand, with the “blessed riffraff” as Barbier said.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the look of Paris during those few days. The
frantic bravery of the gutter-snipe, the enthusiasm of the men, the
calm, sad resignation of the Swiss and Royal Guards, the odd pride of
the mob in being “masters of Paris and looting nothing.” One day, just
after this harmonious revolution, I had a strange musical shock.</p>

<p>Going through the Palais Royal, I heard some young men singing a
familiar air; it was my own:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Forget not our wounded companions, who stood<br /></span>
<span class="i3">In the day of distress by our side;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">While the moss of the valley grew red with their blood<br /></span>
<span class="i3">They stirred not, but conquered and died.”<a name="FNanchor_7_8" id="FNanchor_7_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_8" class="fnanchor">[7]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Not used to such fame I, in great delight, asked the leader whether I
might join in, and incontinently began a hot argument with him as to the
time at which it should be taken. Of course I was not recognised.</p>

<p>As we sang, three of the National Guard handed round their shakos to
collect money for the wounded and there was a welcome deluge of five
franc pieces. The crowd increased and our breathing space became less
and less; we should have ended in being smothered had not a kindly
haberdasher asked us up to her first floor windows, that looked out upon
the covered gallery, whence we could rain down our music upon the crowd
below, as the Pope does his blessing from the balcony of St Peter’s.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_87" id="page_87">{87}</a></span></p>

<p>First we gave them the <i>Marseillaise</i>. At the opening bar the noisy
crowd stood motionless; at the end of the second verse the same silence;
even so with the third. Irate at their apparent coldness, I roared out&mdash;</p>

<p>“Confound it all! <span class="smcap">Sing!</span>”</p>

<p>And they sang.</p>

<p>Remember, those four or five thousand tightly packed people were&mdash;men,
women and children&mdash;hot from the barricades, inflamed with lust for
combat, and imagine how their</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Aux armes, citoyens!”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">rolled out.</p>

<p>Aghast at the explosion we had provoked, our little band stood silent as
birds after a thunder clap.</p>

<p>I, literally not metaphorically, sank on the floor.</p>

<p>Some time before this I had arranged the <i>Marseillaise</i> for full
orchestra and double chorus and had dedicated it to Rouget de Lisle, who
wrote inviting me to go and see him at Choisy, as he had several
proposals to make to me.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I could not go then, as I was on the point of starting for
Italy, and he died before I returned. I only heard much later that he
had written many fine songs besides the <i>Marseillaise</i> and had also a
libretto for <i>Othello</i> put aside; it is probably this that he wished to
discuss with me.</p>

<p>As soon as peace was patched up and Louis Philippe introduced by
Lafayette as “the best of republics” the Academy started work once more.</p>

<p>And as the judges, thanks to a piece which I have since burnt, believed
me reclaimed from my heresies, they gave me the first prize. Although,
in former years, I had been greatly disappointed at not getting it I was
not in the least pleased when I did.</p>

<p>Of course I appreciated its advantages; my parents’ pride, the kudos,
the freedom for five years from money troubles&mdash;yet, knowing the system
on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_88" id="page_88">{88}</a></span> prizes were awarded, could I feel any proper pride in my
success?</p>

<p>Two months after came the distribution of prizes and the performance of
the successful work. It was all very hackneyed.</p>

<p>Every year the same musicians perform pieces turned out on the same
pattern; the same prizes, awarded with the same discrimination, are
handed over with the same ceremony. Every year on the same day, at the
same time, standing on the same step of the same staircase, the same
Academician repeats the same words to the winner.</p>

<p>Day, first Saturday in October; time, four in the afternoon; step, the
third; the Academician&mdash;we all know who.</p>

<p>Then comes the performance with full orchestra (in my case it was not
quite full, for there was only a clarinet and a half, the old boy who
played the first&mdash;having only one tooth and being asthmatic
besides&mdash;being only able to squeeze out a note here and there). The
conductor raises his baton&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The sun rises; ’cello solo, gentle crescendo.</p>

<p>The little birds wake; flute solo, violin tremolo.</p>

<p>The little rills gurgle; alto solo.</p>

<p>The little lambs bleat; oboe solo.</p>

<p>And as the crescendo goes on and the little birds and little brooks and
little beasts finish their performance, one suddenly discovers that it
is noon; then follow the successive airs up to the third, with which the
hero usually expires and the audience once more breathes freely.</p>

<p>Then the secretary, holding in one hand the artificial laurel wreath and
in the other the gold medal, worth enough to keep the recipient until he
leaves for Rome (in point of fact, I have proved that it is worth
exactly a hundred and sixty francs) pompously enunciates the name of the
author.</p>

<p>The laureate rises,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_89" id="page_89">{89}</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“His smooth, chaste forehead, newly shorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">is wreathed with modest blushes.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>He embraces the secretary&mdash;faint applause. He embraces his master,
seated close by&mdash;more applause. Next come his mother, his sisters, his
cousins, and his aunts to the tune of more applause; then his fiancée,
after which&mdash;treading on people’s toes and tearing ladies’ dresses in
the blind confusion of his headlong career&mdash;he regains his seat, bathed
in perspiration. Loud applause and laughter.</p>

<p>This is the crowning moment, and I know lots of people who go for
nothing but the fun of it.</p>

<p>I do not say this in bitterness of spirit, although, when my turn came,
neither father nor mother, nor fiancée<a name="FNanchor_8_9" id="FNanchor_8_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_9" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> were there to congratulate me.
My master was ill, my parents estranged, my mistress&mdash;ah!</p>

<p>So I only embraced the secretary, and I do not fancy that my “modest
blushes” were noticed because, instead of being “newly shorn,” my
forehead was buried in a shock of long red hair, which, in conjunction
with certain other points in my physiognomy certainly earned me a place
in the owl tribe.</p>

<p>Besides, I was not in at all an embrace-inspiring humour that day. Truth
obliges me to confess that I was in a howling, rampant rage.</p>

<p>I must go back a little and explain why.</p>

<p>The subject set was the <i>Last Night of Sardanapalus</i>, and it ended with
his gathering his most beautiful slaves around him and, with them,
mounting the funeral pyre.</p>

<p>I was just going to write a symphonic description of the scene&mdash;the
cries of the unwilling victims; the king’s proud defiance of the flames,
the crash of the falling palace&mdash;when I suddenly bethought me that that
way lay suicide&mdash;since the piano, as usual, would be the only means of
interpretation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_90" id="page_90">{90}</a></span></p>

<p>I therefore waited and, as soon as the prize was awarded and I knew I
could not be deprived of it, I wrote my <span class="smcap">Conflagration</span>.</p>

<p>At the final orchestral rehearsal it made such a sensation that several
of the Academicians came up and congratulated me most warmly, without a
trace of pique at the trick I had played upon them. The rumour of it
having gone abroad, the hall was packed&mdash;for I found I had already made
a sort of bizarre reputation.</p>

<p>Not feeling particularly confident in the powers of Grasset, the
conductor, I stood close beside him, manuscript in hand, while Madame
Malibran, who had been unable to find a seat in the hall, sat on a stool
at my elbow between two double-basses. That was the last time I ever saw
her.</p>

<p>All went smoothly; Sardanapalus assembled his slaves, the fire was
kindled, everyone listened intently, and those who had been at rehearsal
whispered:</p>

<p>“Now it’s coming. Just listen. It’s simply wonderful!”</p>

<p>Curses and excommunications upon those musicians who do not count their
rests!! That damned horn, that should have given the signal to the
side-drums, never came in. The drums were afraid to begin, so gave no
signal to the cymbals, nor the cymbals to the big-drum.</p>

<p>The violins went wobbling on with their futile tremolo and my fire went
out without one crackle!</p>

<p>Only a composer who has been through a like experience can appreciate my
fury.</p>

<p>Giving vent to a wild yell of rage, I flung my score smash into the
middle of the band and knocked over two desks. Madame Malibran jumped as
if she had been shot, and the whole place was in an uproar.</p>

<p>It was a regular catastrophe&mdash;worst and cruellest<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_91" id="page_91">{91}</a></span> of all I had hitherto
borne; but alas! by no means the last.</p>

waned. At my concert everyone noticed his enthusiasm and vociferous
applause.</p>

<p>As my work is exceedingly complicated, it is not surprising that the
execution was by no means perfect; yet some parts of the Symphony made a
sensation. The <i>Scène aux Champs</i> fell quite flat, and, on the advice of
Ferdinand Hiller, I afterwards entirely rewrote it.</p>

<p><i>Sardanapalus</i> was well done, and the <i>Conflagration</i> came off
magnificently. It raised a conflagration in Paris too, in the shape of a
war of musicians and critics.</p>

<p>Naturally the younger men&mdash;particularly those with that sixth sense,
artistic instinct&mdash;were on my side, but Cherubini and his gang were wild
with rage.</p>

<p>He happened to pass the concert-room doors as people were going in, and
a friend stopped him, asking:</p>

<p>“Are you not coming to hear Berlioz’s new thing?”</p>

<p>“I need not zat I go hear how sings should not be done,” he replied.</p>

<p>He was much worse after the concert, and sent for me.</p>

<p>“You go soon,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_94" id="page_94">{94}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“It vill be zat you are cross off ze register of Conservatoire, zat your
studies are finish. But it seem to me zat you should make visit to me.
One goes not out of Conservatoire like out of a stable.”</p>

<p>I very nearly said:</p>

<p>“Why not, since we are treated like horses?” but luckily had the good
sense merely to say that I had not the slightest intention of leaving
Paris without saying farewell to him.</p>

<p>So to Rome, <i>nolens volens</i>, I had to go, useless as it seemed.</p>

<p>The Roman Academy may be of service to painters and sculptors, but, as
far as music is concerned, it is lost time, considering the state of
music in Italy. Neither is the life led by the students exactly
conducive to study and progress.</p>

<p>Usually the five or six laureates arrange to travel in company, and
share expenses. A coach-driver agrees, for a modest sum, to take charge
of this cargo of great men, and dump it down in Italy. As he never
changes horses it takes a long time, and must be rather amusing.</p>

<p>I did not try it, as I had to stay in Paris for various reasons till the
middle of January and then wished to go round by La Côte
Saint-André&mdash;where my laurel wreath earned me a warm welcome&mdash;after
which, alone, and dreary, I turned my face towards Italy.</p>

<small>ITALY</small><br /><br />
<small><span class="smcap">A Wild Interlude</span></small></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> weather was too severe to cross the Alps, I
therefore determined to out-flank them and go by
sea from Marseilles. It was the first time I had
seen the sea and, as some days passed before I could
hear of a boat, I spent most of my time wandering
over the rocks near Notre Dame de la Garde.</p>

<p>After a while I heard of a Sardinian brig bound
for Leghorn, and engaged a passage in her in com<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_97" id="page_97">{97}</a></span>pany
with some decent young fellows I had met in
the Cannebière.</p>

<p>The captain would not undertake to feed us, so,
reckoning that we should make Leghorn in three or
four days, we laid in provisions for a week.</p>

<p>In fine weather, few things are more delightful
than a Mediterranean voyage&mdash;particularly one’s
first. Our first few days were glorious; all my
companions were Italians, and had many stories to
tell&mdash;some true, some not, but all interesting. One
had fought in Greece with Canaris, another&mdash;a
Venetian&mdash;had commanded Byron’s yacht, and the
tales he told accorded well with what one might
expect of the author of <i>Lara</i>.</p>

<p>Time went on, but we got no nearer Leghorn.
Each morning, going on deck, my first question
was, “What town is that?” and the eternal answer
was, “Nizza, signor, still Nizza.” I began to think
that the charming town of Nice had some sort of
magnetic attraction for our boat.</p>

<p>I found out my mistake when a furious Alpine
wind burst down upon us. The captain, to make
up for lost time, crowded on all sail and the vessel
heeled over and drove furiously before the gale.
Towards evening we made the Gulf of Spezzia,
and the tramontana increased to such a pitch that
the sailors themselves trembled at the captain’s
foolhardiness. I stood by the Venetian, holding
on to a bar and listening to his maledictions on the
captain’s madness, when suddenly a fresh gust of
wind caught the boat and sent her over on her
beam-ends, the captain rolling away into the
scuppers.</p>

<p>In a flash the Venetian was at the tiller, shouting
orders to the sailors, who were by this time calling
on the Madonna:</p>

<p>“Don’t bother about the Madonna now,” he
cried, “get in the sails.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_98" id="page_98">{98}</a></span>”</p>

<p>The sails were reefed, the ship righted, and next
day we reached Leghorn with only one sail, so
strong was the wind.</p>

<p>A few hours after, our sailors came to the hotel
in a body to congratulate us on our escape. And,
though the poor devils hardly earned enough to
keep body and soul together, nothing would induce
them to take a farthing. It was only by great persuasion
that we got them to share an impromptu
meal. My friends had confided to me that they
were on the way to join the insurrection in Modena;
they had great hopes of raising Tuscany and then
marching on Rome.</p>

<p>But alas for their young hopes! Two were
arrested before reaching Florence and thrown into
dungeons, where they may still lie rotting; the
others, I heard later, did well in Modena, but finally
shared the fate of gallant and ill-starred Menotti.</p>

<p>So ended their sweet dream of liberty.</p>

<p>I had great trouble in getting from Florence to
Rome. Frenchmen were revolutionists and the
Pope did not welcome them warmly. The Florentine
authorities refused to <i>viser</i> my passport, and nothing
but the energetic protests of Monsieur Horace
Vernet, the director of the Roman Academy, prevailed
on them to let me go.</p>

<p>Still alone, I made my way to Rome. My driver
knew no French so I was reduced to reading the
memoirs of the Empress Josephine, as we dawdled
on our road. The country was not interesting; the
inns were most uncomfortable; nothing gave me
reason to reverse my decision that Italy was a horrid
country and I most unlucky in being compelled to
stay in it.</p>

<p>But one morning we reached a group of houses
called La Storta and, as he poured out a glass of
wine, my <i>vetturino</i> said casually, with a jerk of his
head and thumb:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_99" id="page_99">{99}</a></span></p>

<p>“There is Rome, signore.”</p>

<p>Strange revulsion of feeling! As I gazed down
on the far-off city, standing in purple majesty in
the midst of its vast desolate plain, my heart swelled
with awe and reverence, and suddenly I realised all
the grandeur, all the poetry, all the might of that
heart of the world.</p>

<p>I was still lost in dreams of the past when the
carriage stopped in front of the Academy.</p>

<p>The Villa Medici, the home of the students and
director of the <i>Académie de France</i>, was built in
1557 by Annibale Lippi, one wing being added by
Michael Angelo. It stands on the side of the
Pincian, overlooking the city; on one side of it is
the Pincian Way, on the other the magnificent
gardens designed in Lenôtre’s style, and opposite, in
the midst of the waste fields of the Villa Borghese,
stands Raphael’s house.</p>

<p>Such are the royal quarters that France has munificently
provided for her children. Yet the rooms
of the pupils are mostly small, uncomfortable, and
very badly furnished.</p>

<p>The studios of the painters and sculptors are
scattered about the grounds as well as in the palace,
and from a little balcony, looking over the Ursuline
gardens, there is a glorious view of the Sabine
range, Monte Cavo and Hannibal’s Camp.</p>

<p>There is a fair library of standard classics, but no
modern books whatever; studiously-minded people
may go and kill time there up to three in the afternoon,
for there is really nothing to do. The sole
obligation of the students is, once a year, to send a
sample of their work to the Academy in Paris; for
the rest of the time they do exactly as they
please.</p>

<p>The director simply has to see that rules are kept
and the whole establishment well managed; with
the inmates’ work he has nothing to do whatever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_100" id="page_100">{100}</a></span></p>

<p>It would be hardly fair that he should; to overlook
and advise twenty-two young men in five
different branches of art would hardly be within
one man’s compass.</p>

<p>The Ave Maria was ringing as I entered the
portals of the Villa and, as that was the dinner-hour,
I went straight to the refectory. As soon as I
appeared in the doorway there was a hurrah that
raised the roof.</p>

<p>“Ho! ho! Berlioz! Oh that blessed head! that
fiery mop! that dainty nose! I say, Jalay, his nose
knocks spots out of yours; take a back-seat, my
good man!”</p>

<p>“He can give <i>you</i> points in hair anyway.”</p>

<p>“Ye gods, <i>what</i> a crop!”</p>

<p>“Heigh, Berlioz! how about those infernal side-drums
that wouldn’t start the <i>Fire</i>! By Jove! he
was in a wax. Good reason, too! I say, have you
forgotten me?”</p>

<p>“I know your face well enough, but your
name&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He says ‘you.’ Don’t give yourself airs, old
boy, we are all ‘thou’ here.”</p>

<p>“Well, what is <i>thy</i> name?”</p>

<p>“Signol.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t; it’s <i>Ros</i>signol.”<a name="FNanchor_9_10" id="FNanchor_9_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_10" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>“Lord, what a beastly bad pun!”</p>

<p>“Do let him sit down.”</p>

<p>“Whom? The pun?”</p>

<p>“Get out! Berlioz, of course.”</p>

<p>“I say, Fleury, bring us some punch&mdash;real good
stuff. We’ll stop this idiot’s mouth.”</p>

<p>“Now our musical section is complete.”</p>

<p>“Montfort” (the laureate of the year before me),
“embrace your comrade.”</p>

<p>“No, he sha’n’t!”</p>

<p>“Yes, he shall!” and they all yelled together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_101" id="page_101">{101}</a></span></p>

<p>“Look here; while you others are fighting, he’s
eating all the macaroni. Leave me a bit!”</p>

<p>“Well, embrace him all round and get it done
with.”</p>

<p>“Oh, bother! Now it’s going to begin all over
again.”</p>

<p>“I say, I’m not going to drink wine when there’s
punch.”</p>

<p>“Not much! Break the bottles. Look out,
Fleury!”</p>

<p>“Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Don’t break the
glasses, please! You will want them for the
punch. You would not like to drink punch out
of little glasses.”</p>

<p>“Perish the thought! You are a man of sense,
Fleury. You were only just in time, though.”</p>

<p>Fleury was the prop of the house; a thoroughly
good fellow, who well deserved the trust of the
Academy directors. Nothing ruffled him; he was
so used to our scenes that he kept the aspect of
a graven image, which made it all the funnier
for us.</p>

<p>When I had got over my tempestuous reception,
I looked round the hall. On one wall were about
fifty portraits of former students, on the other a
series of the most outrageous life-sized caricatures,
also of inmates of the Academy. Unluckily,
for want of wall-space, these soon came to an
end.</p>

<p>That evening, after an interview with M. Vernet,
I followed my comrades to the Café Greco&mdash;the
dirtiest, darkest, dampest hole imaginable. How it
justifies its existence as the artist’s favourite café I
cannot imagine. We smoked abominable cigars and
drank coffee that was none the nicer for being served
on dirty little wooden tables, as sticky and greasy
as the walls.</p>

<p>Next day I made Mendelssohn’s acquaintance;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_102" id="page_102">{102}</a></span>
but more of this when I come to write of
Germany.<a name="FNanchor_10_11" id="FNanchor_10_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_11" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>For a while I got on fairly well in this new life,
then gradually my anxiety about my Paris letters,
which were not forthcoming, increased to such an
extent that, in defiance of the kindly expostulations
of M. Horace Vernet, who tried to restrain me by
saying that I must be struck off the list of <i>pensionnaires</i>
if I broke the Academy’s most stringent rule, I
decided to return to Paris.</p>

<p>I started, but at Florence was kept in bed a week
by quinsy, and so made the acquaintance of Schlick,
the Danish sculptor, a thoroughly good fellow of
much talent. During this week I rewrote the Ball
Scene for my <i>Symphonie Fantastique</i>, and added the
present Coda.</p>

<p>It was not quite finished when, the first time I
was able to go out, I fetched my letters from the
post. Among them was one of such unparalleled
impudence that I fairly took leave of my senses.
Needless to say, it was from Camilla’s mother. In
it, after accusing me of <i>bringing annoyance</i> into her
household, she announced the marriage of my <i>fiancée</i>
to M. Pleyel.</p>

<p>In two minutes my plans were laid. I must hurry
to Paris to kill two guilty women and one innocent
man; for, this act of justice done, I, too, must die!</p>

<p>They would expect me, therefore I must go disguised.
I hurried to Schlick and showed him the
letter.</p>

<p>“It is scandalous,” he said. “What will you do?”</p>

<p>I thought it best to deceive him so as to be
absolutely free.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_103" id="page_103">{103}</a></span></p>

<p>“Do? Why, return to France. But I will go
to my father’s, not to Paris.”</p>

<p>“Right!” he replied. “Your own home will
best soothe your wounded heart. Keep up your
spirits.”</p>

<p>“I will; but I must go at once.”</p>

<p>“You can easily go this evening. I know the
official people here, and will get your passport and a
seat for you in the mail. Go and pack.”</p>

<p>Instead of packing, I went to a milliner in the
Lung ‘Arno.</p>

<p>“Madame,” I said, “I want a lady’s-maid’s outfit
by five o’clock&mdash;dress, hat, green veil, everything.
Money is no object. Can you do it?”</p>

<p>She agreed, and leaving a deposit, I went back to
the hotel. Taking the score of the Ball Scene, I
wrote across it:</p>

<p>“I have not time to finish, but if the Concert
Society will perform the piece in the absence of the
composer, I beg that Habeneck will double the flute
passage at the last entry of the theme, and will write
the following chords for full orchestra. That will
be sufficient finale,” threw it into a valise with a
few clothes, loaded my pistols, put into my pockets
two little bottles, one of strychnine, the other of
laudanum; then, conscience-clear with regard to my
arsenal, spent the rest of the time raging up and
down the streets of Florence like a mad dog.</p>

<p>At five, I went back to the shop to try on
my clothes, which were satisfactory, and with the
modiste’s “good wishes for the success of my little
comedy,” I went back to say good-bye to Schlick,
who looked upon me as a lost sheep returning to
the fold!</p>

<p>A farewell glance at Cellini’s <i>Perseus</i>, and we
were off.</p>

<p>League after league went by and I sat with
clenched teeth. I could neither eat nor speak.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_104" id="page_104">{104}</a></span>
About midnight the driver and I exchanged a few
words about my pistols, he remarking that, if
brigands attacked us, we must on no account
attempt to defend ourselves, proceeded to take
off the caps and hide them under the cushions.</p>

<p>“As you like,” I said, indifferently. “I have no
wish to compromise you.”</p>

<p>On our arrival at Genoa (I having tasted nothing
but the juice of an orange, to the astonishment of
the courier, who could not make out whether I
belonged to this world or the next), I found that,
in changing carriages at Pietra Santa, my finery had
been left behind.</p>

<p>“Confound it all!” I thought; “this looks as if
some cursed good angel stood in the way of my
plan.”</p>

<p>Again I hunted up a dressmaker, and after trying
three, succeeded in getting a new outfit. Meanwhile,
the Sardinian people, seeing me trotting after
work-girls like this, took it into their sapient heads
that I must be a conspirator, a <i>carbonero</i>, a liberator,
and refused to <i>viser</i> my passport for Turin. I must
go by Nice.</p>

<p>“Then, for heaven’s sake, <i>viser</i> it for Nice. I
don’t care. I’ll go <i>viâ</i> the infernal regions so long
as I get through.”</p>

<p>Which was the greater fool&mdash;the policeman, who
saw in every Frenchman an emissary of the Revolution,
or myself, who thought I could not set foot in
Paris undisguised; forgetting that, by hiding for a
day in a hotel, I could have found fifty women to
rig me out perfectly?</p>

<p>Self-engrossed people are really delightful. They
fancy everyone is thinking about them, and the
deadly earnest with which they act up to the idea
is simply delicious!</p>

<p>So, behold me on my way to Nice, going over
and over my little Parisian drama.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_105" id="page_105">{105}</a></span></p>

<p>Disguised as the Countess de M.’s lady’s-maid, I
would go to the house about nine o’clock with an
important letter. While it was being read, I would
pull out my double-barrelled pistols, kill number
one and number two, seize number three by the
hair and finish her off likewise; after which, if this
vocal and instrumental concert had gathered an
audience, I would turn the fourth barrel upon
myself. Should it miss fire (such things happen
occasionally), I had a final resource in my little
bottles.</p>

<p>Grand climax! It seems rather a pity it never
came off.</p>

<p>Now, despite my rage, I began to say:</p>

<p>“Yes, it will be most agreeable, but&mdash;to have to
kill myself too, is distinctly annoying. To say farewell
to earth, to art; to leave behind me only the
reputation of a churl, who did not understand the
gentle art of living; to leave my symphony unfinished,
the scores unwritten&mdash;those glorious scores
that float through my brain.... Ah!”</p>

<p>“But no; they shall, they must all die!”</p>

<p>Each minute I drew nearer to France.</p>

<p>That night, on the Cornice road, love of life and
love of art whispered sweet promises of days to
come, and I sat listening, vaguely, dreamily, when
the driver stopped to put on the drag. Roused
mentally by the thunder of the waves upon the iron
cliffs below, the stupendous majesty of Nature burst
upon me with greater force than ever before, and
woke anew the tempest in my heart&mdash;the awful
wrestling of Life and Death.</p>

<p>Holding with both hands on to my seat, I let out
a wild “Ha!” so hoarse, so savage, so diabolic that
the startled driver bounced aside as if he had indeed
had a demon for his fellow-traveller.</p>

<p>In my first lucid moments I remember thinking,
“If only I could find some solid point of rock to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_106" id="page_106">{106}</a></span>
cling to before the next wave of fury and madness
sweeps over my head, I might yet be saved!”</p>

<p>I found one. We stopped to change horses at a
little Sardinian village&mdash;Ventimiglia, I believe<a name="FNanchor_11_12" id="FNanchor_11_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_12" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>&mdash;and,
begging five minutes from the guard, I hurried into
a café, seized a scrap of paper, and wrote to M.
Vernet, praying him to keep me on the roll of
students, if I were not already crossed off, assuring
him that I had not yet broken the rule, and promising
not to cross the frontier until I received his
answer at Nice, where I would await it.</p>

<p>Temporarily safeguarded by my word of honour,
yet free to take up my Red Indian scheme of vengeance
again, should I be excluded from the Academy,
I got quietly into the carriage and suddenly discovered
that ... I was hungry, having eaten nothing
since leaving Florence.</p>

<p>Oh, good, gross Nature! I was positively reviving!</p>

<p>I got to Nice, still growling at intervals; but,
after a few days came M. Vernet’s answer&mdash;a
friendly paternal letter that touched me deeply.</p>

<p>Though ignorant of the reason of my trouble, the
great artist gave me the best advice, showing me
that hard work and love of art were the sovereign
remedies for a mind diseased; telling me that the
Minister knew nothing of my escapade, and that I
should be received with open arms in Rome.</p>

<p>“They are saved!” I sighed. “Suppose I live
too?&mdash;live quietly, happily, musically? Why not?
Let’s try!”</p>

<p>So for a month I dwelt alone at Nice, writing the
<i>King Lear</i> overture, bathing in the sea, wandering
through orange groves, and sleeping on the healthy
slopes of the Villefranche hills.</p>

<p>Thus passed the twenty happiest days of my life.</p>

<p>But the King of Sardinia’s police put an end to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_107" id="page_107">{107}</a></span>
this idyllic life. I had spoken to one or two officers
of the garrison, and had even played billiards with
them. This was sufficient to rouse the darkest
suspicions.</p>

<p>“This musician cannot have come to hear <i>Mathilde
de Sabran</i>” (the only opera given just then), “since
he never goes near the theatre. He wanders alone
on the hills, no doubt expecting a signal from some
revolutionary vessel; he never dines at <i>table d’hôte</i>
in order to avoid spies; he is ingratiating himself
with our officers in order to start negotiations with
them in the name of Young Italy. It is a flagrant
conspiracy!”</p>

<p>I was summoned to the police office.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here, sir?”</p>

<p>“Recruiting after a terrible illness. I compose,
I dream, I thank God for the glorious sun, the sea,
the flower-clothed hillsides&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You are not an artist?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Yet you wander about with a book in your
hand. Are you making plans?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the plan of an overture to <i>King Lear</i>&mdash;at
least the instrumentation is nearly finished, and I
believe its reception will be tremendous.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by reception? Who is this
King Lear?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a wretched old English king.”</p>

<p>“English king?”</p>

<p>“Yes; according to Shakespeare he lived about
eighteen hundred years ago, and was idiotic enough
to divide his kingdom between two wicked daughters,
who kicked him out when he had nothing more to
give them. You see, there are few kings that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never mind kings now. What do you mean by
instrumentation?”</p>

<p>“It is a musical term.”</p>

<p>“Same excuse again! Sir, I know that you cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_108" id="page_108">{108}</a></span>
possibly compose wandering about the beach with
only a pencil and paper, and no piano, so tell me
where you wish to go, and your passport shall be
made out. You cannot remain here.”</p>

<p>“Then I will go back to Rome, and, by your
leave, continue to compose without a piano.”</p>

<p>Next day I left Nice, greatly against the grain, but
I was brisk and light-hearted, well and thoroughly
cured. Thus once more loaded pistols missed fire.</p>

<p>Never mind. My little drama was interesting,
and I cannot help regretting it&mdash;just a little!</p>

<small>ITALIAN MUSIC</small></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">I did</span> not hurry back to Rome, but spent some time
in Genoa, where I heard Paër’s <i>Agnese</i>, and where
I could find no trace of bust or statue or tradition
of Columbus. I also tried in vain to hear something
of Paganini, who at that moment was electrifying<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_109" id="page_109">{109}</a></span>
Paris, while I&mdash;with my usual luck&mdash;was kicking
my heels in his native town.</p>

<p>Thence I went back to Florence, which of all Italian
cities appeals to me most. There the spleen that
devours me in Rome and Naples takes flight. With
barely a handful of francs&mdash;since my little excursion
had made a big hole in my income, knowing no one
and being consequently entirely free&mdash;I passed
delicious days visiting odd corners, dreaming of
Dante and Michael Angelo, and reading Shakespeare
in the shady woods on the Arno bank.</p>

<p>Knowing, however, that the Tuscan capital could
not compare with Naples and Milan in opera, I took
no thought for music until I heard people at <i>table
d’hôte</i> talking of Bellini’s <i>Montecchi</i>, which was soon
to be given. Not only did they praise the music,
but also the libretto. Italians, as a rule, care so
little for the words of an opera that I was surprised,
and thought:</p>

<p>“At last I shall hear an opera worthy of that
glorious play. What a subject it is! Simply made
for music. The ball at Capulet’s house, where
young Romeo first sees his dazzling love; the
street fight whereat Tybalt presides&mdash;patron of
anger and revenge; that indescribable night scene
at Juliet’s balcony; the witty sallies of Mercutio;
the prattle of the nurse; the solemnity of the friar
trying to soothe these conflicting elements; the
awful catastrophe and the reconciliation of the rival
families above the bodies of the ill-fated lovers.”</p>

<p>I hurried to the Pergola Theatre.</p>

<p>What a disappointment! No ball, no Mercutio, no
babbling nurse, no balcony scene, no Shakespeare!</p>

<p>And Romeo sung by a small thin <i>woman</i>, Juliet
by a tall stout one. Why&mdash;in the name of all things
musical&mdash;why?</p>

<p>Do they think that women’s voices sound best together?
Then why not do away with men’s entirely?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_110" id="page_110">{110}</a></span></p>

<p>Why should Juliet’s lover be deprived of all
virility? Could a woman or a child have slain
Tybalt, having burst the gates of Juliet’s tomb
and stretched County Paris a corpse at his feet?</p>

<p>Surely Othello and Moses with high women’s
voices would not be more utterly incongruous.</p>

<p>In justice, I must say that Bellini has got a most
beautiful effect in a really powerful incident. The
lovers, dragged apart by angry parents, tear themselves
free and rush into each other’s arms, crying:
“We meet again in heaven.”</p>

<p>He has used a quick, impassioned <i>motif</i>, sung in
unison, that expresses most eloquently the idea of
perfect union.</p>

<p>I was unwontedly moved, and applauded heartily.
Thinking that I had better know the worst that
Italian opera could perpetrate, had better&mdash;as it
were&mdash;drink the cup to the dregs, I went to hear
Paccini’s <i>Vestal</i>. Although I knew it had nothing
in common with Spontini’s opera, I little dreamed
of the bitterness of the cup I had to face. Licinius,
again, was a woman.... After a few minutes’
painfully strained attention I cried, with Hamlet,
“Wormwood! wormwood!” and fled, feeling I
could swallow no more, and stamping so hard that
my great toe was sore for three days after.</p>

<p>Poor Italy!</p>

<p>At least, thought I, it will be better in the
churches. This was what I heard.</p>

<p>A funeral service for the elder son of Louis
Bonaparte and Queen Hortense was being held.</p>

<p>What thoughts crowded into my mind as I stood
amid the flaming torches in the crape-hung church!
A Bonaparte! <i>His</i> nephew, almost his grandson,
dead at twenty; his mother, with his only brother,
an exile in England.</p>

<p>I thought of the gay creole child dancing on the
deck of the ship that carried her to France, untitled<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_111" id="page_111">{111}</a></span>
daughter of Madame Beauharnais, adopted daughter
of the master of Europe, Queen of Holland, exiled,
forgotten, bereft, without a kingdom, without a home!</p>

<p>Oh, Beethoven! Great soul! Titan, who
couldst conceive the <i>Eroica</i> and the <i>Funeral March</i>,
is not this a meet subject for thy genius?...</p>

<p>The organist pulled out the small flute stops and
fooled about over twittering little airs at the top of
the key-board, exactly like wrens preening themselves
on a sunny wall in winter!</p>

<p>Again, hearing great things of the Corpus Christi
music in Rome, I hurried there in company with
several Italians bent on the same errand.</p>

<p>They raved all the way of the wonders we should
see, dangling before my eyes tiaras, mitres, chasubles,
etc., etc.</p>

<p>“But the music?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, signor, there will be an immense choir,”
then they went back to their crosses and incense,
and bell-ringing and cannon.</p>

<p>“But the music?” I repeated.</p>

<p>“Oh, there will be a gigantic choir.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyway,” I thought, “things will be on a
magnificent scale,” and my vivid imagination raced off
to the glories of Solomon’s Temple and the colossal
pageants of ancient Egypt. Cruel gift of Nature
that clothes dull life in a golden veil! It simply
made more appalling and impossible the shrill nasal
voices of the singers, the quacking clarinets, the
bellowing trombones, and the rampant vulgarity of
the big drums. It was brutal unadulterated cacophony.</p>

<p>Rome calls this military music!</p>

<p>Then, behold me once more safe at the Villa
Medici, welcomed by the director and my comrades,
who most kindly and tactfully hid their curiosity
concerning my crazy journey. I had gone off having
good reason to go; I had come back&mdash;so much the
better. No remarks, no questions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_112" id="page_112">{112}</a></span></p>

<p>“He is a charming fellow; his execution is as
perfect as his genius, and that is saying a good deal.
All I have heard of his is splendid, and I believe him
to be one of the great musicians of his time.</p>

<p>“He has been my cicerone. Every morning I
hunt him up; he plays me Beethoven; we sing
<i>Armida</i>; then he takes me to see ruins that, I must
candidly own, do not impress me much. His is one of
those clear pure souls one does not often come across;
he believes firmly in his Lutheran creed, and I am
afraid I shocked him terribly by laughing at the Bible.</p>

<p>“I have to thank him for the only pleasant
moments I had during the anxious days of my first
stay in Rome.</p>

<p>“You may imagine what I felt like when I received
that astonishing letter from Madame Moke
announcing her daughter’s marriage. She calmly
said that she never agreed to our engagement, and
begs me, dear kind creature! not to kill myself.</p>

<p>“Hiller knows the whole story, and how I left
Paris with her ring upon my finger, given in exchange
for mine. However, I am quite recovered and can

<small>IN THE MOUNTAINS</small></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">I quickly</span> fell into the Academy routine. A bell
called us to meals, and we went as we were&mdash;with
straw hats, blouses plastered with clay, slippered
feet, no ties&mdash;in fact, in studio undress.</p>

<p>After breakfast we lounged about the garden at
quoits, tennis, target practice, shooting the misguided
blackbirds who came within range, or trained
our puppies; in all of which amusements M. Horace
often joined us.</p>

<p>In the evening, at that everlasting Café Greco,
we smoked the pipe of peace with the “men down
below,” as we dubbed artists not attached to the
Academy. After which we dispersed; those who
virtuously returned to the Academy barracks gathering
in the garden portico, where my bad guitar and
worse voice were in great request, and where we
sang <i>Freyschütz</i>, <i>Oberon</i>, <i>Iphigenia</i> or <i>Don Giovanni</i>,
for, to the credit of my messmates be it spoken,
their musical taste was far from low.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we sometimes had what we
called English concerts. We each chose a different
song and sang it in a different key, beginning by
signal one after another; as this concert in twenty-four
keys went on crescendo, the frightened dogs
in the Pincio kept up a howling obligato and the
barbers on the Piazza di Spagna down below winked
at each other, saying slyly, “French music!”</p>

<p>On Thursdays we went to Madame Vernet’s
receptions, where we met the best society in Rome;
and on Sundays we usually went long excursions
into the country. With the director’s permission,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_114" id="page_114">{114}</a></span>
longer journeys might be undertaken and usually
several of our number were absent.</p>

<p>As for me, since Rome never appealed to me, I
took refuge in the mountains; had I not done so,
I doubt whether I could have lived through that
time. It may seem strange that the mighty shade
of old Rome should not impress me, but I had come
from Paris, the centre of civilisation, and was at one
blow severed from music, from theatres (they were
only open for four months), from literature, since
the Papal censor excluded almost everything that I
cared to read, from excitements, from everything
that, to me, meant real life.</p>

<p>Balls, evening parties, shooting days in the Campagna,
and rides made up the inane mill-round in
which I turned. Add to that the scirocco, the
incessant yearning for my beloved art, my sorrowful
memories, the misery of being for two years exiled
from the musical world, and the utter impossibility
of composing in that stagnating atmosphere, and it
will hardly be wondered at that I was as savage as
a trained bull-dog, and that the well-meant efforts
of my friends to divert me only drove me to the
verge of madness.</p>

<p>I remember in one of my Campagna rides with
Mendelssohn expressing my surprise that no one
had ever written a scherzo on Shakespeare’s sparkling
little poem <i>Queen Mab</i>. He, too, was surprised,
and I was very sorry I had put the idea into
his head. For years I lived in dread that he had
used it, for he would have made it impossible&mdash;or,
at any rate, very risky&mdash;for anyone to attempt it
after him. Luckily he forgot.</p>

<p>My usual remedy for spleen was a trip to Subiaco,
which seemed to put new life into me.</p>

<p>An old grey suit, a straw hat, a guitar, a gun and
six piastres were all my stock-in-trade. Thus I
wandered, shooting or singing, careless where I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_115" id="page_115">{115}</a></span>
might pass the night; sometimes hurrying, again
stopping to investigate some ancient tomb, to listen
silently to the distant bells of St Peter’s, far away
in the plain; interrupting my hunt for a flock of
lapwing to jot down a note for a symphony, and, in
short, enjoying to the full my absolute freedom.</p>

<p>Sometimes&mdash;a glorious landscape spread before
me&mdash;I chanted, to the guitar accompaniment, long-remembered
verses of the Æneid, the death of Pallas,
the despair of Evander, the sad end of Amata, and
the death of Lavinia’s noble lover, and worked myself
up to an incredible pitch of excitement that
ended in floods of tears. Elicited originally by the
woes of these mythical beings, my overwhelming
grief ended by becoming personal, and my tears
flowed in self-pity for my sorrows, my doubtful
future, my broken career.</p>

<p>The odd thing was that, all the time, I was quite
able to analyse my feelings, although I ended by
collapsing under these chaotic miseries, murmuring
a mixture of Virgil, Dante and Shakespeare&mdash;“Nessun
maggior dolore&mdash;che ricordarsi&mdash;O poor Ophelia!&mdash;good-night,
sweet ladies&mdash;vitaque cum gemitu&mdash;sub
umbras&mdash;” and so fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>How crazy, you say? Yes, but how happy.
Sensible people cannot understand this intensity of
being, this actual joy in existing, in dragging from
life the uttermost it has to give in height and depth.
Here, in the Parisian whirlpool, how well I recall
the wild Abruzzi country where I spent so long.</p>

<p>Bitter-sweet memories of days now passed for
ever. Days of utter irresponsible freedom to abolish
time, to scorn ambition, to forget love and glory.</p>

<p>Oh strong, grand Italy! Wild Italy! Heedless
of that sister Italy&mdash;the Italy of Art!</p>

<p>In time I became friendly with many of the
villagers; one in particular, named Crispino, grew
very fond of me; he not only got me perfumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_116" id="page_116">{116}</a></span>
pipe-stems (I had not then found out that I disliked
the sort of excitement produced by tobacco) but
balls, powder and even percussion caps. I first won
his affection by helping to serenade his mistress and
by singing a duet with him to that untameable young
person; then fixed them by a present of two shirts
and a pair of trousers. Crispino could not write, so
when he had anything to tell me he came to Rome.
What were thirty leagues to him?</p>

<p>At the Academy we usually left our doors open;
one January morning&mdash;having left the mountains in
October I had had three months’ boredom&mdash;on turning
over in bed, I found, standing over me, a great
sun-burnt scamp with pointed hat and twisted
leggings, waiting quite quietly till I woke.</p>

<p>“Hallo, Crispino! What brings you here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I have just come to&mdash;see you.”</p>

<p>“Yes; what next?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;just now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Just now?”</p>

<p>“To tell the truth&mdash;I’ve got no money.”</p>

<p>“Now come! That’s something like the truth.
You have no money; what business is that of mine,
oh mightiest of scamps?”</p>

<p>“I’m no scamp. If you call me a scamp because I
have no money, you are right, but if it is because I
was two years at Civita Vecchia, you are wrong. I
wasn’t sent to the galleys for stealing, but just for
good honest shots at strangers in the mountains.”</p>

<p>It was all nonsense, of course, I don’t believe he
ever shot so much as a monk. However, he was
hurt in his feelings and would only accept three
piastres, a shirt and a neckerchief.</p>

<p>The poor fellow was killed two years ago in a
brawl. Shall I meet him in a better world?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the miserable oblivion and dishonour into which
music has sunk in Rome I found but one small sign<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_117" id="page_117">{117}</a></span>
of honest life. It was among the pfifferari, players of
a little popular instrument, a surviving relic of antiquity.
They were strolling musicians who, at Christmastide,
came down from the mountains in groups of
four or five armed with bagpipes and <i>pfifferi</i>, a kind
of oboe, to play before the images of the Virgin.</p>

<p>I used to spend hours in watching them, there
was something so quaintly mysterious in their wild
aspect as they stood&mdash;head slightly turned over one
shoulder, their bright dark eyes fixed devoutly on
the holy figure, almost as still as the image itself.</p>

<p>At a distance the effect is indescribable and few
escape its spell. When I heard it in its native
haunts, among the volcanic rocks and dark pine
forests of the Abruzzi, I could almost believe myself
transported back through the ages to the days
of Evander, the Arcadian.</p>

<p>Of this time, musically, I have little to tell. I
wrote a long and incoherent overture to <i>Rob Roy</i>,
which I burnt immediately after its performance in
Paris; the <i>Scène aux Champs</i> of the <i>Symphonie Fantastique</i>,
which I rewrote entirely in the Borghese gardens;
the <i>Chant de Bonheur</i> for <i>Lelio</i>, and lastly a
little song called <i>La Captive</i>, inspired by Victor
Hugo’s lovely poem.</p>

<p>One day I was at Subiaco with Lefebvre, the
architect. As he drew, he knocked over a book
with his elbow; it was <i>Les Orientales</i>. I picked it
up and it opened at that particular page. Turning to
Lefebvre I said:</p>

<p>“If I had any paper I would write music to this
exquisite poem; I can <i>hear it</i>.”</p>

<p>“That is soon done,” said he, and he ruled a
sheet whereon I wrote my song. A fortnight later
I remembered it and shewed it to Mademoiselle
Vernet, saying:</p>

<p>“I wish you would try this, for I have quite
forgotten what it is like.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_118" id="page_118">{118}</a></span>”</p>

<p>I scribbled a piano accompaniment, and it took
so well that, by the end of the month, M. Vernet,
driven nearly mad by its reiteration, said:</p>

<p>“Look here, Berlioz. Next time you go up to
the mountains don’t evolve any more songs; your
<i>Captive</i> is making life in the Villa impossible. I
can’t go a yard without hearing it sung or snored
or growled. It is simply distracting! I am going
to discharge one of the servants to-day, and I shall
only engage another on condition that he does not
sing the <i>Captive</i>.”</p>

<p>The only other thing I did was the <i>Resurrexit</i>
that I sent as my obligatory work to Paris. The
Powers said that I had made <i>great progress</i>. As it
was simply a piece of the mass performed at St
Roch several years before I got the prize, it does
not say much for the judgment of the Immortals!</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Again</span> did that wretched malady&mdash;call it moral, nervous, imaginary, what
you will, <i>I</i> call it spleen&mdash;which is really the fever of loneliness,
seize upon me.</p>

<p>I had first felt it at La Côte Saint-André, when I was sixteen. One
lovely May morning I was sitting in a meadow, under the shade of a
spreading oak, reading Montjoie’s <i>Manuscript found at Posilippo</i>.
Engrossed in my story, I only gradually became aware of sweet and
plaintive songs trembling in the breeze. It was the Rogation procession;
in the old time-honoured way, that has always seemed to me most poetical
and touching, the peasants were going round the fields, praying for the
blessing of heaven on their crops. I watched them kneel before a
green-wreathed wooden cross, while the priest blessed the land, then
they passed on, and the sweet voices died in the distance.</p>

<p>Silence&mdash;the gentle rustling of the flowering wheat, the faint cry of
the quail to his mate, a dead leaf floating from an oak, the deep
throbbing of my own heart. Life seemed so very far away!</p>

<p>On the horizon the Alpine glaciers shone in the rising sun. Here was
Meylan; far over those mountains lay Italy, Naples, Posilippo&mdash;the whole
world of my story. Oh! for the wings of a dove, to leave this clogging
earth-bound body! Oh! for life at its highest and best; for love, for
rapture, for ecstasy; for the clinging clasp of hot embraces! Love!
glory! where is my bright particular star, O my heart? my Stella Montis?
Gone for ever?</p>

<p>Then came the crisis with crushing force. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_121" id="page_121">{121}</a></span> suffered horribly, rolling
on the earth, spreading wide my empty arms, tearing up handfuls of grass
and daisies&mdash;that opened wide their innocent eyes&mdash;as I fought my awful
sense of oppression and desolation and bereavement.</p>

<p>Yet what was all this compared to the agony I have suffered since, to
the torment of my soul that increases daily?</p>

<p>I never thought of death; suicide had no place in my mind. I wanted
life, life in its fullest capacity of love and joy and
happiness&mdash;furious and all-devouring&mdash;life that would use to the
uttermost my superabundant energies.</p>

<p>That is not spleen. Spleen follows upon it; it is the mental, moral and
physical exhaustion that is the inevitable sequence to such a crisis.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One day as I slept, worn out by this reaction, in the laurel wood of the
Villa, rolled up like a hedgehog in a heap of dry leaves, two of my
comrades woke me.</p>

<p>“Now then, Silenus, get up and come to Naples. We’re off.”</p>

<p>“Off to the devil! You know I have no money.”</p>

<p>“Idiot! Can’t we lend you some? Come, Dantan, help me to heave him up or
we shall get no sense out of him. There you are! Brush him down a bit.
Now be off and get a month’s leave from Monsieur Horace.”</p>

<p>And I went.</p>

<p>What shall I say of Naples? Clear bright sky, fecund earth, dazzling
sunlight!</p>

<p>So many have described this lovely land that I need not do it again. I
wandered in the grounds of the Villa Reale, pondering on the woes of
Tasso, and rowed to Nisita to watch the sun go down behind Capo Miseno
to the accompaniment of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_122" id="page_122">{122}</a></span> thousand minor chords of the rippling sea.
As I stood, a soldier, who spoke very fair French, came up and offered
to show me the curiosities of the island. I accepted gratefully, and
after an hour’s stroll together I took out my purse. Drawing back, he
put my hand aside, saying:</p>

<p>“Monsieur, I want nothing. I ask nothing but&mdash;but&mdash;that you will pray
God for me.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I will,” I said; “it’s an odd notion, but I will do it.”</p>

<p>And that night I seriously did say a Paternoster for him after I got to
bed. I was beginning a second when I went into fits of laughter. So I am
afraid that, as far as my intervention is concerned, the poor man is
still a plain sergeant.</p>

<p>Next day the wind had freshened, and our passage back was stormy.
However, we landed at last, and my sailors, overjoyed at the thirty
francs I had promised them, insisted on my dining with them. They were
such ruffianly-looking creatures that, when they led me through a lonely
poplar wood, I began to doubt them, poor lazzaroni! However, we soon
came to a cottage where my amphitryons gave orders for the feast&mdash;a
mountain of macaroni, into which I plunged my hand with them; a great
pot of Posilippo wine, from which we drank in turn&mdash;I after a toothless
old man, the eldest of the family, for, with these good fellows, respect
for age comes before even courtesy to guests.</p>

<p>Then the old man began discussing politics, and talking of King Joachim,
who was very near his heart, until he got so deeply affected that, to
turn his thoughts, his children made him tell me of a long and dangerous
voyage he had once made when, after <i>three days and two nights</i> at sea,
he had been thrown on a far-off island which the aborigines called Elba,
and where it was rumoured Napoleon had once been kept prisoner. Of
course I sym<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_123" id="page_123">{123}</a></span>pathised, and congratulated the old man on his wonderful
escape.</p>

<p>The young men were greatly delighted at my interest and attention; they
whispered together, there was a mysterious hurrying to and fro, and I
gathered that some surprise was in store.</p>

<p>As I rose to leave, the tallest of the lazzaroni, with shy politeness,
begged me to accept a present, the best they had to offer, calculated to
make the most callous of men weep.</p>

<p>It was a gigantic&mdash;onion! which I received with modest dignity worthy of
the occasion, and which I carried off in triumph, after a thousand vows
of eternal friendship.</p>

<p>That night I went to San Carlo, and, for the first time, heard music in
Italy. It was at least meritorious, though the noise made by the
conductor tapping his desk bothered me greatly. I was assured, however,
that without this support, the musicians <i>could not possibly keep in
time</i>!</p>

<p>The musical attractions of Naples could not rival those of the
surrounding country, so I passed most of my time in exploring until one
day, breakfasting at Castellamare with Munier, the marine painter, whom
we had christened Neptune, he said:</p>

<p>“What shall we do? I am sick of Naples. Don’t let us go back.”</p>

<p>“Shall we go to Sicily?”</p>

<p>“By all means. Give me time to finish a study I have begun, and I can
catch the five o’clock boat.”</p>

<p>“All right. Let’s see how much money we have.”</p>

<p>Upon investigation there turned out to be enough to take us to Palermo,
but for coming back we should have had to trust to Providence, as the
monks say. So we separated, he to paint the sea, I to walk back to Rome
over the mountains, in company with two Swedish officers whom I knew.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_124" id="page_124">{124}</a></span></p>

<p>Thus by way of Isola di Sora, Alatri, Subiaco, and Tivoli, and with but
few adventures we got back to the Eternal City, and my life of
stagnation began once more.</p>

<p>I dreamed of Paris, finished my monodrama, and revised the <i>Symphonie
Fantastique</i>, then, considering that the time had come to have them
performed, I obtained M. Vernet’s permission to go back to France before
my two years expired. I sat for my portrait, took a last trip to Tivoli,
Albano, and Palestrina; sold my gun, broke my guitar, wrote in several
albums, gave a punch-party to my fellow-students, spent a lot of time
stroking M. Vernet’s two dogs&mdash;faithful companions of my shooting
excursions&mdash;had an attack of profound sorrow at the thought that I might
see this poetic land no more; climbed into a wretched old chaise, and
then&mdash;good-bye to Rome!</p>

<p>I went by Florence, Milan, and Turin, and at last, on the 12th May 1832,
coming down the slopes of Mont Cenis, I beheld at my feet that smiling
Grésivaudan valley, where my happiest hours and brightest dreams of
childhood had passed. There was St Eynard, there the house where shone
my Stella Montis; there, through the shimmering blue haze, my
grandfather’s place bade me welcome. Surely Italy had naught to show as
lovely as this! Yet what is this strange oppression on my heart? Afar I
hear the dull and ominous murmur of Paris commanding my presence.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<span class="smcap">Florence</span>, <i>May 1832</i>.&mdash;I arrived yesterday,
and found your letter. Why do you not say
whether the sale of my medal realised enough to
pay the two hundred francs I owe you?</p>

<p>“I left Rome without regret. The Academy<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_125" id="page_125">{125}</a></span>
life had grown intolerable, and I spent all my
evenings with the Director’s family, who have been
most kind. Mademoiselle Vernet is prettier, and
her father younger than ever.</p>

<p>“I am glad to be here, yet my sensations are so
curiously confused that I cannot explain them even
to myself. I know no one, have no adventures, am
utterly alone. Perhaps that is what affects me so
oddly. I seem to be not myself but some stranger&mdash;some
Russian or Englishman&mdash;sauntering along
the Lung ‘Arno. Berlioz is merely a distant acquaintance.</p>

<p>“This cursed throat of mine is still troublesome;
it would be the death of me if I would allow it.</p>

<p>“I shall not be in Paris till November or December,
as I go straight home from here. Many thanks
for your invitation to Frankfort; sooner or later I
mean to accept it.”</p></div>

me, Madame, a new and most agreeable task.</p>

<p>“An intellectual woman not only desires that I
should write her my musings, but undertakes to
read them without emphasizing too much their
ridiculous side.</p>

<p>“It is hardly generous of me to take advantage
of your kindness, but are we not all selfish?</p>

<p>“For my part, I must own that whenever such a
temptation comes I shall fall into it with the utmost
alacrity.</p>

<p>“I should have done so sooner had I not, on my
descent from the Alps, been caught like a ball on the
bound and tossed from villa to villa round Grenoble.</p>

<p>“My fear was that, on returning to France, I
might have to parody Voltaire and say: ‘The more
I see of other lands, <i>the less</i> I love my country.’ But<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_126" id="page_126">{126}</a></span>
all the glories of the glorious kingdom of Naples
are powerless beside the ineffable charms of my
beautiful vale of the Isère.</p>

<p>“Of society, however, I cannot say the same.
The advantage is entirely with the absent, who are
not ‘always wrong’ in spite of the proverb.</p>

<p>“Despite my herculean efforts to turn the conversation,
the good folks here <i>will</i> insist on talking art,
music and poetry to me, and you may imagine how
provincials talk! They have most weird notions,
theories and ideas that make an artist’s blood curdle
in his veins, and, withal, the calmest assumption of
infallibility.</p>

<p>“One would think to hear them talk of Byron,
Goethe, Beethoven, that they were respectable bootmakers
or tailors, with a little more talent than their
compeers.</p>

<p>“Nothing is good enough, there is no reverence,
no respect, no enthusiasm!</p>

<p>“Thus living in a crowd, I am utterly, cruelly alone
and am parched for want of music.</p>

<p>“No longer can I look forward to my evening’s
pleasure with Mademoiselle Louise and her piano; no
more can I try her sweet patience by demanding and
re-demanding those sublime adagios.</p>

<p>“You smile, Madame? No doubt you murmur
that I know neither what I want nor where I would
be&mdash;that I am, in fact, half demented.</p>

<p>“My father devised a charming cure for my malady;
he said I ought to marry and forthwith unearthed a
rich damsel, informing me that, since he could leave
me but little, it was my duty to marry money.</p>

<p>“At first I laughed, but finding that he was in sober
earnest, I was obliged to say firmly that, since I
could not love the lady in question, I would not sell
myself at any price.</p>

<p>“That ended the discussion, but it upset me
terribly, for I thought my father knew me better.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_127" id="page_127">{127}</a></span></p>

<p>“Madame, do you not think I am right?</p>

<p>“As I promised Monsieur Horace, I will go to Paris
at the end of the year to fire my musical broadside,
after which I intend to start at once for Berlin.</p>

advantage of your kindness and will conclude by
asking your pardon for my garrulity.</p></div>

were she, alone, a woman I should simply hate her,
for I loathe coquettes. As it is&mdash;‘Providence having
ordered all for the best’ as the good say&mdash;we are

<p>“No, my dear fellow, you, being you, naturally
‘could not do otherwise’ than make me wait two
months for your letter; naturally, also, I ‘could not
do otherwise’ than be angry with you therefor.
However, as I was not wounded to the quick by
your neglect, I wrote you a second letter which I
burnt, remembering Napoleon’s wise saying, ‘Certain
things should never be said.’ If so, still less
should they be written.</p>

<small>MARRIAGE</small></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">After</span> spending the summer in Dauphiny, copying my
monodrama, I went on to Paris, hoping to give two
concerts before starting on my German wanderings.</p>

<p>Apropos of the <i>Chorus of Shades</i> in this same composition,
a rather comical thing happened in Rome.
In order to have it printed it was necessary for it to
pass the Papal censor. Now for this language of the
dead, incomprehensible to the living, I had written
pure gibberish (I have since substituted French, saving
my unknown tongue for the <i>Damnation de Faust</i>) of
which the censor demanded a translation.</p>

<p>They tried a German, who could make nothing
of it; an Englishman, the same; Danes, Swedes,
Russians, Spaniards&mdash;equally useless. Deadlock at
the censorial office! At last, after much cogitation
one of the officials evolved an argument that appealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_129" id="page_129">{129}</a></span>
forcibly and convincingly to his colleagues: “Since
none of these people understand the language,
perhaps the Romans will not understand it either.
In that case I think we might authorise the printing,
without danger to religion or morals.”</p>

<p>So the <i>Shades</i> got printed. Oh reckless censors!
Suppose it had been Sanscrit!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of my first visits in Paris was to Cherubini,
whom I found much aged and enfeebled. He
received me with such affection that I was quite
disarmed and said:</p>

<p>“I fear me the poor man is nigh unto death!”</p>

<p>It was not long before I found my forebodings
quite uncalled for; as far as I was concerned he
was as lively as ever.</p>

<p>As my old rooms in the Rue Richelieu were let,
some influence compelled me to cross the road to
the house in which Miss Smithson had lived, Rue
Neuve St Marc, where I found a lodging. Next
day, meeting the old servant, I said:</p>

<p>“Do you know what has become of Miss Smithson?”</p>

<p>“Why, monsieur, she is in Paris; she only left
the rooms you are in a few days ago to go to the
Rue de Rivoli. She is manageress of an English
theatre that is to open in a few days.”</p>

<p>Dumfoundered, I felt that this was indeed the
hand of fate. For more than two years I had heard
no word of “fair Ophelia” and here I arrive in Paris
at the very moment she returns from her tour in
Northern Europe.</p>

<p>A mystic might well find arguments in defence of his
cult in this strange coincidence. What I said was this:</p>

<p>“I have come to Paris to perform my monodrama.
If I go to the theatre before the concert, I shall
certainly have another attack of that <i>delirium tremens</i>;
all volition will be taken from me; I shall be incapable
of the thought and care essential to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_130" id="page_130">{130}</a></span>
success of my work. So first my concert, then I
will see her if I die for it and will fight no more
against this strange destiny.”</p>

<p>And, despite the Shakespearian names staring at
me daily from all the walls in Paris, I kept sternly
to my purpose.</p>

<p>The programme was to consist of the <i>Symphonie
Fantastique</i> followed by <i>Lelio</i>, the monodrama which
is the complement of the former and is the second
part of my <i>Episode in an Artist’s Life</i>.</p>

<p>Now trace the extraordinary sequence.</p>

<p>Two days before the concert&mdash;which I felt would
be my farewell to life and art&mdash;I was in Schlesinger’s
music-shop, when an Englishman came in and went
out almost at once.</p>

<p>“Who is that?” I asked, in idle curiosity.</p>

<p>“Schutter, of <i>Galignani’s Messenger</i>. Ah!” cried
Schlesinger, “give me a box for your concert. He
knows Miss Smithson, I will get him to persuade
her to go.”</p>

<p>I trembled, but dared not refuse; so, running
after M. Schutter, he explained matters and got his
promise to do his best to induce Miss Smithson to go.</p>

<p>Now while I had been busy over my preparations
the unfortunate actress had been also busy&mdash;in
ruining herself.</p>

<p>She did not realise that Shakespeare was no
longer new to the changeable, frivolous Parisian
public and innocently counted on a reception such
as she had had three years before.</p>

<p>The Romantic School was now on the rising tide
and its apostles were not anxious that it should be
stemmed by the colossus of dramatic poetry nor
that their wholesale filchings from his works should
be brought to light.</p>

<p>Hence, sparse audiences, mean receipts and considerable
running expenses that swallowed up all
the poor manageress’s savings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_131" id="page_131">{131}</a></span></p>

<p>Schutter, long afterwards, told me that he found
Miss Smithson too dejected to accept his invitation;
her sister, however, persuaded her that the change
would be good and she at length allowed him to
take her down to the carriage. On the way to the
Conservatoire her eyes fell on the programme;
even then, as she read my name (which they had
taken care not to mention) she little knew that she
was, herself, the heroine of my work. But, in her
box, she could not help seeing that she was the
subject of conversation in the hall and when Habeneck
came on to conduct with me&mdash;gasping with
excitement&mdash;behind him, she said to herself:</p>

<p>“It is indeed he&mdash;poor young man! But he will
have forgotten me&mdash;at least&mdash;I hope so.”</p>

<p>The symphony made a tremendous sensation;
that was the day of great enthusiasms and the hall
of the Conservatoire (from which I am now shut
out) echoed with the applause of that crowd of
musicians. The success, the fiery <i>motifs</i> of my
work, its cries of love and passion and the mere
vibration of such a gigantic orchestra at close
quarters, all worked upon Miss Smithson’s sensitive
organisation, and in her heart of hearts she
cried:</p>

<p>“Ah! If he but loved me now!&mdash;--”</p>

<p>During the interval Schutter and Schlesinger made
thinly-veiled allusions to my sorrows and when, in
the <i>Monodrama</i>, Lelio said:</p>

<p>“Shall I never meet this Juliet, this Ophelia,
for whom my heart wearies?”</p>

<p>“Juliet! Ophelia!” she thought, “he must be
thinking still of me! He loves me yet!”</p>

<p>From that moment she heard no more; in a
dream she sat till the end; in a dream she returned
home. That was the 9th December 1832. But
while the web of one part of my life was being
woven on one side of the hall, on the other side<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_132" id="page_132">{132}</a></span>
another was in the weaving&mdash;compounded of the
hatred and wounded vanity of Fétis.</p>

<p>Before going to Italy I used to earn money by
correcting musical proofs. Troupenas, having given
me some Beethoven scores to do that had previously
been revised by Fétis, I found them full of the most
impertinent and unmeaning corrections. I was so
furious that I went off to Troupenas and said:</p>

<p>“M. Fétis’ corrections are criminal. They are
entirely opposed to Beethoven’s intention, and if this
edition is published, I warn you that I shall denounce
it to every musician I meet.”</p>

<p>Which I accordingly did and there was such an
outcry that Troupenas was obliged to suppress the
corrections and Fétis thought it politic to tell a lie
and announce in the <i>Revue Musicale</i> that there was
no truth in the rumour that he had corrected
Beethoven’s symphonies. In <i>Lelio</i> I gibbeted him
still farther by putting into my hero’s mouth quotations
of his own that the audience recognised and
applauded, with much laughter. Fétis, sitting in
the front row of the gallery, got the blow full in
the face, and needless to say, was thereafter more
my inveterate enemy than ever.</p>

<p>But I forgot all this next day when I went to call
upon Miss Smithson and began that long course of
torturing hopes and fears that lasted nearly a year.</p>

<p>Her mother and sister and my parents were all
opposed to our marriage, and while various distressing
scenes were in progress, the English theatre
closed in debt.</p>

<p>To add to her misfortunes, getting out of her
carriage, she missed her footing, and falling, broke
her leg just above the ankle. The injury was most
severe and it was feared that she would be lame for
life.</p>

<p>Her accident elicited the greatest sympathy in
Paris. Mademoiselle Mars, particularly, came for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_133" id="page_133">{133}</a></span>ward,
placing her purse, influence, everything she had
at poor Ophelia’s disposal. I managed to organise a
benefit, in which Chopin and Liszt took part, which
brought in enough to pay the most pressing debts.</p>

<p>At last, in the summer of 1833, Henriette being
still weak and quite ruined, I married her in the face
of the opposition of our two families. All our
resources on the wedding day were three hundred
francs lent me by Gounet. But what did it matter,
since she was mine?</p>

<p>“<i>August 1833.</i>&mdash;You true friend, not to despair of
my future! These cowards cannot realise that, all
the time, I am learning, observing, gathering ideas
and knowledge. Bending before the storm, I still
grow; the wind does but blow off a few leaves;
the green fruit upon my branches holds too firmly
to be shaken off. Your trust helps and encourages
me.</p>

<p>“Have I told you of my parting with Henriette&mdash;of
our scenes, despair, reproaches, which ended in
my taking poison? Her protestations of love and
sorrow brought back my desire to live; I took an
emetic, was ill three days and am still alive! In her
self-abasement she offered to do anything I chose,
but now she begins to hesitate again. I will wait
no more and have written that, unless she goes with
me to the Town Hall on Saturday to be married, I
leave for Berlin at once. She shall see that I, who
for so long have languished at her feet, can rise, can
leave her, can live for those who love and understand
me.</p>

<p>“To help me to bear this horrible parting a
strange chance has thrown in my way a charming
girl of eighteen, who has fled from a brute who
bought her&mdash;a mere child&mdash;and has kept her shut
up like a slave for four years. Rather than go back
to him, she says she will drown herself and my idea
is to take her to Berlin, and by Spontini’s influence,
place her in some chorus. I will try and make her
love me, and if I succeed, I will fan into life the
smouldering embers in my own heart and persuade
myself that I love her. My passport is ready; I
must make an end of things here. Henriette will
be miserable but I have nothing to reproach myself
with.</p>

<p>“I would give my life this minute for a month of
<i>perfect love</i> with her.</p>

<p>“She must abide the consequences of her unstable<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_135" id="page_135">{135}</a></span>
character; she will weep and despair at first, then
will dry her tears and end by believing me in the
wrong.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“<i>11th October 1833.</i>&mdash;I am married! All opposition
has been in vain. Henriette has told me of the
hundred and one lies they spread abroad. I was
epileptic, I was mad&mdash;nothing was too bad. But
we have listened to our own hearts and all is well.</p>

<p>“This winter we are going to Berlin, but before
leaving I must give a horrid concert.</p>

<p>“How <i>awfully</i> I love my poor Ophelia! When
once we can get rid of her troublesome sister, life
will be hard but quite happy.</p>

<p>“We are at Vincennes, where my wife can spend
her days in the Park, but I go to Paris every day.
Our marriage has made the devil’s own row there.</p>

<p>“My little fugitive is provided for. Jules Janin
has arranged to send her away.</p>

<p>“Write soon. I love to answer, in order to tell
you of the heaven I live in&mdash;it needs but you!
Surely love and friendship like yours and mine is
one of the supreme joys of this world!”</p></div>

<h2><a name="XXII" id="XXII"></a>XXII<br /><br />
<small>NEWSPAPER BONDAGE</small></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">At</span> the time of our marriage our sole income was
my scholarship, which still had a year and a half to
run; but the Minister of the Interior absolved me
from the regulation German tour. I had a fair
number of friends and adherents in Paris and firm
faith in the future.</p>

<p>To pay my wife’s debts, I had to start <i>benefit-mongering</i>.
My friends rallied round me&mdash;amongst
them Alexandre Dumas, who was all his life my<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_136" id="page_136">{136}</a></span>
most devoted helper&mdash;and after untold annoyances
we arranged a theatrical performance, followed by a
concert at the Théâtre Italien.</p>

<p>The programme was Dumas’ <i>Antony</i>, played by
Firmin and Madame Dorval, followed by the fourth
act of <i>Hamlet</i>, by my wife and some English
amateurs; then a concert consisting of my <i>Symphonie
Fantastique</i>, <i>Francs-Juges</i>, <i>Sardanapalus</i>, a chorus of
Weber and his <i>Concert-Stück</i>, played by Liszt.</p>

<p>If the concert had ever come off entirely it would
have lasted till one in the morning. But it did not,
and for the sake of young musicians I must tell what
happened.</p>

<p>Not being versed in the manners and customs of
theatrical musicians, I arranged with the manager to
take his theatre and orchestra, adding to the latter
some players from the Opera, an impossibly dangerous
combination, since the theatre <i>employés</i> were bound
by contract to take part gratuitously in concerts in
their own house, and, therefore, naturally look upon
them as a burden. By engaging paid artists, I simply
added to their grievance, and they determined to be
revenged.</p>

<p>Then, my wife and I being equally ignorant of
the petty intrigues of the theatrical world we took no
precautions to insure her success. We never even
sent a ticket to the <i>claque</i>, and Madame Dorval,
believing Henriette’s triumph secured, of course
took measures to arrange for her own. Besides,
she played splendidly, so it was no wonder she was
applauded and recalled.</p>

<p>The fourth act of <i>Hamlet</i>, separated from its context,
was incomprehensible to French people and
fell absolutely flat. They even noticed (although
her talent and grace were as great as ever) how
difficult my poor wife found it to raise herself from
her kneeling position by her father’s bier, by resting
one hand on the stage. Gone was her magnetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_137" id="page_137">{137}</a></span>
power to thrill her audience, and, at the fall of the
curtain, those who had idolised her did not even
recall her once! It was heart-breaking. My poor
Ophelia, the twilight had indeed crept on!</p>

<p>As to the concert, the <i>Francs-Juges</i> was poorly
played but well received; the <i>Concert-Stück</i>, played
by Liszt with the passionate impetuosity he always
put into it, created a furore, and I, carried away by
enthusiasm, was idiotic enough to embrace him on
the stage, a piece of stupidity fortunately condoned
by the audience.</p>

<p>From then things went badly, and by the time we
arrived at the symphony not only were my pulses
beating like sledge-hammers, but it was very late
indeed. I knew nothing of the rule of the Théâtre
Italien, that its musicians need not play after midnight,
and when, after Weber’s <i>Chorus</i>, I turned to
review my orchestra before raising my baton, I found
that it consisted of five violins, two violas, four
’cellos, and a trombone, all the others having slipped
quietly away.</p>

<p>In my consternation I could not think what to do.
The audience did not seem inclined to leave and
loudly called for the symphony, one voice in the
gallery shouting, “Give us the <i>Marche au Supplice</i>!”</p>

<p>“How can I,” cried I, “perform such a thing
with five violins? Is it my fault that the orchestra
has disappeared?”</p>

<p>I was crimson with rage and shame.</p>

<p>With disappointed murmurs the people melted
away. Of course my enemies announced that my
music “drove musicians out of the place.”</p>

<p>That miserable evening brought in seven thousand
francs, which went into the gulf of my wife’s debts
without, alas! filling it up. That was only done
after years of struggle and privation.</p>

<p>I longed to give Henriette a splendid revenge,
but there were no English actors in Paris to help<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_138" id="page_138">{138}</a></span>
her with a complete play, and we both saw that
mutilated Shakespeare was worse than useless. I was,
therefore, obliged to content myself with taking
vengeance for the malicious reports about my music,
and, with Henriette’s full approval, I arranged for a
concert of my own works at the Conservatoire.</p>

<p>It was a terrible risk for a penniless man, but
here, as ever, my wife shewed herself the courageous
opponent of half-measures and steadfastly determined
to face the chance of positive penury.</p>

<p>The concert, for which I engaged the very best
artists, amongst whom were many of my friends,
was a triumphant success. I was vindicated.</p>

<p>My musicians (none of whom came from the
Italien) beamed with joy, and, to crown all, when
the audience had dispersed I found waiting for me
a man with long black hair, piercing eyes, and
wasted form&mdash;genius-haunted, a colossus among
giants&mdash;whom I had never seen before, yet who
stirred within me a strange emotion.</p>

<p>Catching my hand, he poured forth a flood of
burning praise and appreciation that fired my heart
and head.</p>

<p>It was Paganini.</p>

<p>This was on the 22nd December 1833.</p>

<p>Thus began my friendship with that great artist
to whom I owe so much and whose generosity
towards me has given rise to such absurd and
wicked reports. Some weeks later he said:</p>

<p>“I have a beautiful Strad. viola which I long to
play in public. Will you write me a solo for it? I
could not trust anyone but you.”</p>

<p>“To do that one ought to play the viola,” I
objected. “You alone could do it satisfactorily.”</p>

<p>But he insisted:</p>

<p>“I am too ill to compose; it would be useless to
try. You will do it properly.”</p>

<p>So to please him I tried to write a viola solo with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_139" id="page_139">{139}</a></span>
orchestral accompaniment, feeling sure that his
power would enable him to dominate the orchestra.
It seemed to me an entirely new idea, and I burned
to carry it through. However, he called soon after
and asked to see a sketch of his part.</p>

<p>“This won’t do,” he said, looking at the pauses,
“there is too much silence. I must be playing all
the time.”</p>

<p>“Did I not tell you so?” I answered. “What
you want is a viola concerto, and you are the only
one who can write it.”</p>

<p>He seemed disappointed and dropped the subject;
a few days later, suffering from the throat trouble
of which he afterwards died, he left for Nice and
did not come back for three years.</p>

<p>Still ruminating over my idea, I wove round the
viola solo a series of scenes, drawn from my memories
of wanderings in the Abruzzi, which I called <i>Childe
Harold</i>, as there seemed to me about the whole
symphony a poetic melancholy worthy of Byron’s
hero. It was first performed at my concert, 23rd
November 1834, but Girard, the conductor, made a
terrible hash of the <i>Pilgrim’s March</i>. However,
being doubtful of my own powers, I still allowed
him to direct my concerts until, after the fourth
performance of <i>Harold</i>, seeing that he would not
take it at the proper <i>tempo</i>, I assumed command myself,
and never but once after that broke my rule of
conducting my own compositions.</p>

<p>We shall see how much cause I had to regret that
one exception.</p>

<p>“I will not write the usual empty phrases on
your loss yet, if anything could soften the blow,
it would be that your father’s death was as peaceful
as one could wish. You speak of my father. He
wrote kindly and quickly in answer to my letter
announcing the birth of my boy. Henriette thanks
you for your messages; she, too, understands the
depth of our friendship. I could write all night
but, as I have to tug at my galley-oar all day, I must
go to sleep.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“<i>30th November 1834.</i>&mdash;I quite expected a letter
from you to-day, and although I am dropping with
fatigue, I must snatch half an hour to answer it.
The <i>Symphonie Fantastique</i> is out, and, as our poor
Liszt has dropped a terrible lot of money over it,
we arranged with Schlesinger that not one copy
was to be given away. They are twenty francs.
Shall I buy one for you?</p>

<p>“Would to heaven I could send it you without
all this preface, but you know we are still very
straitened. My wife and I are as happy as it is
possible to be, in spite of our worldly troubles,
and little Louis is the dearest and sweetest of
children.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“<i>10th January 1835.</i>&mdash;If I had had time I should
already have begun another work I am thinking of,
but I am obliged to scribble these wretched, ill-paid
articles. Ah! if only art counted for something
with the Government perhaps I should not be reduced
to this. Never mind, I must find time somehow.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“So you have been in Milan! Not a town I like,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_141" id="page_141">{141}</a></span>
but it is the threshold of Italy. I cannot tell you
how much, when the weather is fine, I long for
my ancient Campagna and the wild hills that I loved.</p>

<p>“You ask for news of us.</p>

<p>“Louis can nearly walk alone and Henriette is
more devoted to him than ever. I work like a
nigger for the four papers whence I get my daily
bread. They are the <i>Rénovateur</i>, which pays badly;
the <i>Monde Dramatique</i> and <i>Gazette Musicale</i> which pay
only fairly; the <i>Débats</i>, which pays well.</p>

<p>“Added to this is the nightmare of my musical
life; I cannot find time to compose.</p>

<p>“I have begun a gigantic piece of work for seven
hundred musicians, to the memory of the great men
of France.</p>

<p>“It would soon be done if I had but one quiet
month, but I dare not give up a single day to it,
lest we should want for absolute necessaries.</p>

<p>“Which concert do you refer to? I have given
seven this season and shall begin again in November.</p>

Musard,<a name="FNanchor_12_13" id="FNanchor_12_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_13" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> who, puffed up by the success of his
dancing-den concerts, looks upon himself as a
superior Mozart. Mozart never composed anything
like the ‘Pistol-shot Quadrille,’ consequently Mozart
died of want.</p>

<p>“Musard is earning twenty thousand francs a year,
and Ballanche, the immortal author of <i>Orpheus</i> and
<i>Antigone</i> was nearly thrown into prison, because he
owed two hundred francs.</p>

<p>“Think of it, Ferrand; does not madness lie that
way? If I were a bachelor, so that my rash doings
would recoil on myself alone, I know what I would
do.</p>

<p>“Never mind that now, though. Love me always
and, to please me, read de Vigny’s <i>Chatterton</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_142" id="page_142">{142}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“<i>December 1835.</i>&mdash;Do not think me a sinner for
leaving you so long in silence. You can have no
idea of my work&mdash;but I need not emphasise that,
for you know how much pleasure I have in writing
to you and that I should not lightly forego it.</p>

<p>“I have seen Coste, who is publishing serially
<i>Great Men of Italy</i>, and he is going to approach you
about contributing some articles. Among those now
out is a life of Benvenuto Cellini. Read it, if you
are not already familiar with the autobiography of
that bandit of genius.</p>

<p>“<i>Harold</i> is more successful even than last year,
and I think it quite outdoes the <i>Fantastique</i>.</p>

Alfred de Vigny<a name="FNanchor_13_14" id="FNanchor_13_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_14" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and Auguste Barbier have written
me a poem full of dainty vivacity and colour. I
have not begun to work at the music yet, because
I am in the same predicament as my hero, Cellini&mdash;short
of money. Good reports from Germany,
thanks to Liszt’s piano arrangement of my Symphony.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“<i>April 1826.</i>&mdash;I still work frightfully hard at
journalism. You know I write concert critiques for
the <i>Débats</i>, which are signed ‘H.’</p>

<p>“They seem to be making a stir. Parisian artists
call them epoch-making.</p>

<p>“In spite of M. Bertin (the editor’s) wish, I
refused to review either <i>I Puritani</i> or that wretched
<i>Juive</i>. I should have had to find too much fault,
and people would have put it down to jealousy.</p>

<p>“Then there is the <i>Rénovateur</i>, wherein I can hardly
control my wrath over all these ‘pretty little trifles’;
and <i>Picturesque Italy</i> has dragged an article out of me.</p>

<p>“Next, the <i>Gazette Musicale</i> plagues me for a
<i>résumé</i> of the week’s inanities every Sunday.</p>

<p>“Added to that I have tried every concert room<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_143" id="page_143">{143}</a></span>
in Paris, with the idea of giving a concert, and find
none suitable except the Conservatoire, which is not
available until after the last of the regular concerts
on the 3rd May.</p>

<p>“We often talk of you to Barbier; he is a kindred
soul whom you would love. No one understands
better than he the grandeur and nobility of an artist’s
calling.</p>

<p>“Germany still talks of me; Vienna asks for a
copy of the score of the <i>Fantastique</i>, but I tell them
I cannot possibly let them have it, as I propose to
give it on tour myself.</p>

<p>“All the poets in Paris, from Scribe to Victor
Hugo, offer me subjects, but those idiotic directors
stand in the way. Some day I will set my foot upon
their necks.</p>

<p>“Now I must be off to the office of the <i>Débats</i>
with my article on Beethoven’s <i>C Minor</i>.</p>

<p>“Meyerbeer is coming soon to superintend his
<i>Huguenots</i>, which I am most anxious to hear. He is
the only recognised musician who has shown a keen
interest in me.</p>

<p>“Onslow has been paying me his usual bombastic
compliments on the <i>Pilgrim’s March</i>. I am glad to
think there was not a word of truth in them, I prefer
open hatred to honeyed venom.”</p></div>

<small>THE REQUIEM</small></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">In</span> 1836 M. de Gasparin, Minister of the Interior,
feeling that religious music should be better supported,
allocated, yearly, a sum of 3000 francs to
be given to a French composer, chosen by the
Minister, for either a mass or an oratorio; his idea
being also to have it executed at the expense of the
Government.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_144" id="page_144">{144}</a></span></p>

<p>“I shall begin with Berlioz,” he said, “I am
sure he could write a good Requiem.”</p>

<p>A friend of M. de Gasparin’s son told me this.
My surprise was only equalled by my delight, but,
to make sure, I asked an audience of M. de Gasparin.</p>

<p>“It is quite true,” he said, “I am going out of
office, and this is my last bequest. You have, of
course, received the official notification.”</p>

<p>“No, monsieur; it was by a mere chance that I
heard of your kind intentions towards me.”</p>

<p>“What! you ought to have had it a week ago.
It must be an official oversight; I will look into
it.”</p>

<p>But nothing happened, and I finally spoke to the
Minister’s son, who told me that there was an intrigue
on foot to put off my commission until his father’s
retirement, after which the Director of Fine Arts&mdash;who
had no love for me, but whom I need not
name since he is dead&mdash;hoped that it would be
shelved.</p>

<p>This Monsieur X. was a Rossinist. One day I
heard him giving his opinion of composers, ancient
and modern, and rejecting them all, except Beethoven,
whom he forgot. Suddenly he bethought him
and said:</p>

<p>“Let’s see. I believe there is another&mdash;a German&mdash;what
is his name? They play his symphonies at
the Conservatoire. You may know him, Monsieur
Berlioz?”</p>

<p>“Beethoven.”</p>

<p>“Ah yes, Beethoven. I believe he has a certain
amount of talent.”</p>

<p>I heard that myself. <i>Beethoven not devoid of talent!</i></p>

<p>M. de Gasparin had no intention of being ignored;
therefore, finding that nothing had been done, he
sent for M. X. and ordered him sternly to make
out my appointment at once.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_145" id="page_145">{145}</a></span></p>

<p>Naturally this snub did not increase M. X.’s
friendly feeling towards me but, armed with my
decree, I set to work with the greatest ardour.</p>

<p>I had so long ached to try my hand at a Requiem
that I flung myself into it body and soul. My head
seemed bursting with the ferment of ideas, and I
actually had to invent a sort of musical short-hand
to get on fast enough.</p>

<p>All composers know the bitter despair of losing
beautiful ideas through want of time to jot them
down.</p>

<p>In spite of the rapidity with which I wrote, I
afterwards made but few corrections.</p>

<p>Is it not strange that, during that volcanic time,
I should twice over have dreamed that I was sitting
in the Meylan garden, under a beautiful weeping
acacia, alone. Estelle was not there, and I kept
asking:</p>

<p>“Where is she? Where is she?”</p>

<p>Who can explain it? Only those who recognise
the affinity of the mysteries of the human heart
with those of the magnet.</p>

<p>Here, briefly, is a list of the miseries I endured
over that Requiem.</p>

<p>It was arranged that it should be performed at
the memorial service held every July for the victims
of the Revolution of 1830. I, consequently, had
the parts copied, and was beginning rehearsals,
when I was told to stop, as the service was to be
held without music.</p>

<p>Of course the new Minister owed a certain
amount to my copyists and chorus (without mentioning
myself), yet will it be believed that for five
months I had to besiege that department for those
few hundred francs? At last, losing all patience,
I had a pretty lively quarrel with M. X., and as I
left his room the guns of the Invalides proclaimed
the fall of Constantine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_146" id="page_146">{146}</a></span></p>

<p>Two hours later he sent for me in hot haste.
A funeral service was to be held for General
Damrémont and the soldiers who had fallen in the
siege.</p>

<p>Now mark! This being a military affair, General
Bernard had charge of it, and in this way M. X.
hoped to get rid of me and also of the necessity of
paying his just debts.</p>

<p>Here the drama becomes complicated.</p>

<p>Cherubini, hearing that my Requiem was to be
performed, worked himself into a fever, for he
considered that <i>his</i> Requiem should have a monopoly
of such ceremonies. His rights, his dignity, his
genius, all set aside in favour of a hot-headed young
heretic!! His friends, headed by Halévy, started
a cabal to oust me.</p>

<p>Being one morning in the <i>Débats</i> office, I saw
Halévy come in. Now M. Bertin, the editor, has
always been one of my best and kindest friends,
and the frigid reception he and his son Armand gave
the visitor somewhat disconcerted him&mdash;my presence
still more so&mdash;and he found a change of tactics
advisable.</p>

<p>He followed M. Bertin into the next room, and
I, through the open door, heard him say that
“Cherubini took it so to heart that he was ill in
bed, and he (Halévy) had come to beg M. Bertin
to use his influence in getting him the consolation
of the Legion of Honour.”</p>

<p>M. Berlin’s cold voice broke in:</p>

<p>“Certainly, my dear Halévy, we will do our best
to get Cherubini such a well-merited distinction.
But as far as the Requiem is concerned, if Berlioz
gives way one jot, <i>I will never speak to him
again</i>.”</p>

<p>So much for that failure. Next came a blacker
plot.</p>

<p>General Bernard agreed that I should have a free<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_147" id="page_147">{147}</a></span>
hand, and rehearsals had already begun when M.
X. sent for me again. This time it was:</p>

<p>“Habeneck has always conducted our great
official performances, and I know he would be
terribly hurt at being left out of this. Are you on
good terms with him?”</p>

<p>“Why, no. We have quarrelled, goodness only
knows why&mdash;I don’t! He has not spoken to me
for three years. I never troubled to find out the
reason, but he began by refusing to conduct one of
my concerts. Still, if he wishes to conduct this one,
he may, but I reserve the right of conducting one
rehearsal.”</p>

<p>On the great day princes, ministers, peers, deputies,
the press&mdash;home and foreign&mdash;and a mighty crowd
gathered in the Invalides. It was most important
that I should have a real success, failure would have
crushed me irretrievably.</p>

<p>My performers were rather curiously arranged.
To get the right effect in the <i>Tuba mirum</i>, the four
brass bands were placed one at each corner of the
enormous body of instrumentalists and choristers.
As they join in, the <i>tempo</i> doubles, and it is, of
course, of the utmost importance that the time
should be absolutely clearly indicated. Otherwise,
my Titanic cataclysm&mdash;prepared with so much
thought and care by means of original and hitherto
unknown combinations of instruments to represent
the Last Judgment&mdash;becomes merely a hideous
pandemonium.</p>

<p>Suspicious as usual, I took care to be close to
Habeneck&mdash;in fact, back to back with him&mdash;keeping
an eye on the group of kettledrums (which he
could not see) as the critical moment drew near.</p>

<p>There are about a thousand bars in my Requiem;
will it be believed that at this&mdash;the most important
of all&mdash;Habeneck <i>calmly laid down his baton and, with
the utmost deliberation, took a pinch of snuff</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_148" id="page_148">{148}</a></span></p>

<p>But my eye was upon him; turning on my heel,
in a flash I stretched out my arm and marked the
four mighty beats. The executants followed me,
all went right, and my long-dreamed-of effect was
a magnificent triumph.</p>

<p>“Dear me,” bleated Habeneck, “I was quite in
a perspiration; without you we should have been
done for.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we should,” I answered, eyeing him
steadily.</p>

<p>Could it be that this man, in conjunction with
M. X. and Cherubini, planned this dastardly stroke?</p>

<p>I do not like to think so, yet I have not the
slightest doubt. God forgive me if I wrong them.</p>

<p>The Requiem had succeeded, but then began the
usual sordid trouble about payment.</p>

<p>General Bernard, a thoroughly honourable man,
had promised me ten thousand francs for the performance
as soon as I brought from the Minister of
the Interior a promise to pay the sum ordered by
the late Minister&mdash;M. de Gasparin&mdash;and also that
due to the copyists and choristers.</p>

<p>But do you think I could get this letter? It was
written out ready for his signature, and from ten
to four I waited in his ante-room. At last he
emerged and, being button-holed by his secretary,
scrawled his name to the precious document, and
without a moment’s loss of time I hurried off to
General Bernard, who promptly handed me the ten
thousand francs, which I spent entirely in paying
the performers.</p>

<p>Of course I thought the Minister’s three thousand
would soon follow.</p>

<p><i>Sancta simplicitas!</i> Will it be credited that only
by making most unpleasant, almost scandalous, scenes
could I, at the end of <i>eight months</i>, get that money?</p>

<p>Later on, when my good friend, M. de Gasparin,
again came into office, he tried to make up for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_149" id="page_149">{149}</a></span>
mortification by giving me the Legion of Honour.
But by that time I was past caring for such a
commonplace distinction.</p>

<p>Duponchel, manager of the Opera and Bordogni,
the singing-master, got it at the same time.</p>

<p>When the Requiem was printed, I dedicated it to
M. de Gasparin, all the more willingly that he was
not then in power.</p>

<p>What added greatly to the humour of the situation
was that the opposition newspapers dubbed me
a “Government parasite,” and said I had been paid
thirty thousand francs. They only added a nought.</p>

<p>Thus is history written.</p>

<p>Ere long Cherubini played me another charming
trick.</p>

<p>A professorship of Harmony was vacant at the
Conservatoire, for which I applied. Cherubini sent
for me, and, in his most honeyed voice, said:</p>

<p>“Is it zat you present yourself for ze ’armonee?”</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“Zen you vill get it. You ’ave a reputation,
influence&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Since I asked for it because I want it, I am glad,
monsieur.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but zat is vhere I am bothair; I vill zat
anozzer get it.”</p>

<p>“Then, monsieur, I withdraw.”</p>

<p>“No, no! I vill not ’ave zat, because you see
zey will say I am ze cause zat you vizdraw.”</p>

<p>“Then I won’t withdraw.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but&mdash;zen you vill get ze place&mdash;and I
did not vish it for you.”</p>

<p>“Then what am I to do?”</p>

<p>“You know zat you must be pianist, for teach ze
’armonee at Conservatoire, my tear fallow.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I never thought of that. That is a capital
excuse. You want me to say that, not being a
pianist, I withdraw?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_150" id="page_150">{150}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“Just so! just so, my tear fallow! But <i>I</i> am not
ze excuse zat you vizdraw&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Certainly not, monsieur; it was stupid of me to
forget that only pianists could teach Harmony.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my tear boy; embrace me, for I lof you
much.”</p>

<p>A week after he gave the place to Bienaimé, who
played the piano as well as I do!</p>

<p>Now I call that a thoroughly well-planned trick,
and I was among the first to laugh at it.</p>

<p>Soon after, I seriously hurt the feelings of the
friend who “lofed me much.”</p>

<p>It was at the first performance of his <i>Ali Baba</i>,
about the emptiest, feeblest thing he ever wrote.
Near the end of the first act, tired of hearing nothing
striking, I called out:</p>

<p>“Twenty francs for an idea!”</p>

<p>In the middle of the second I raised my bid.</p>

<p>“Forty francs for an idea!”</p>

<p>The finale commenced.</p>

<p>“Eighty francs for an idea!”</p>

<p>The finale ended and I took myself off, remarking:</p>

<p>“By Jove! I give it up. I’m not rich enough!”</p>

<p>Of course indignant friends of Cherubini told him
of my insolence and, considering how he “lofed”
me, he must have thought me an ungrateful wretch.</p>

<p>I had better explain here how I got on to the
staff of the <i>Débats</i>. One day, being utterly wretched
and not knowing where to turn for money, I wrote
an extravagantly amusing tale called “Rubini at
Calais.” These contrasts happen sometimes.</p>

<p>A few days after it came out in the <i>Gazette
Musicale</i>, the <i>Journal des Débats</i> reproduced it, with
a few words of cordial appreciation from the editor.</p>

<p>I went to thank M. Bertin, who offered me the
proud post of musical editor. This enabled me to
throw up my least well-paid work; yet, all the
same, I abominate criticism, and feel quite ill from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_151" id="page_151">{151}</a></span>
the moment I see the advertisement of a new performance
until I have written my article on it. The
ever-recurring task poisons my life. I hate circumlocution,
diplomacy, trimming, and all half-measures
and concessions. They are so much gall and
wormwood to me.</p>

<p>People call me passionate, rude, spiteful, prejudiced.
O scrubby louts! If you but knew all I
<i>want</i> to write of you, you would find your present
bed of nettles a couch of roses compared to the
gridiron on which I long to toast you!</p>

<p>At least I can truly say that never have I grudged
the fullest, most heartfelt praise to all that aims at
the good and true and beautiful&mdash;even when it
emanates from my bitterest foes.</p>

<p>One day Armand Bertin, who was grieved at my
narrow circumstances, told me he had heard that I
was to be appointed professor of composition at the
Conservatoire, in spite of Cherubini. M. X., whom
I met at the Opera, confirmed it, and I begged him
to tender my thanks to the Minister for a position
that would be to me assured comfort.</p>

<p>That was the last I heard of it.</p>

<p>Still I got something&mdash;the post of librarian, which
I still hold and which brings me in 118 francs a
month.</p>

<p>While I was in England,<a name="FNanchor_14_15" id="FNanchor_14_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_15" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> several worthy patriots
tried to eject me, and it was only the kind intervention
of Victor Hugo&mdash;who had some authority
in the Chamber&mdash;that saved it for me. Another
good friend of mine was M. Charles Blanc, who
became Director of Fine Arts, and frequently helped
me with a ready warmth I shall never forget.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_152" id="page_152">{152}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XXIV" id="XXIV"></a>XXIV<br /><br />
<small>FRIENDS IN NEED</small></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">And</span> now for my opera and its deadly failure.</p>

<p>The strange career of Benvenuto Cellini had made
such an impression on me that I stupidly concluded
that it would be both dramatic and interesting to
other people. I therefore asked Léon de Wailly
and Auguste Barbier to write me a libretto on it.
I must own that even our friends thought it had not
the elements essential to success, but it pleased me,
and even now I cannot see that it is inferior to many
others that are played daily.</p>

<p>In order to please the management of the <i>Débats</i>,
Duponchel, manager of the Opera&mdash;who looked
upon me as a species of lunatic&mdash;read the libretto
and agreed to take my opera. After which he went
about saying that he was going to put it on, not on
account of the music, which was ridiculous, but of
the book, which was charming.</p>

<p>Never shall I forget the misery of those three
months’ rehearsals. The indifference of the actors,
riding for a fall, Habeneck’s bad temper, the vague
rumours I heard on all sides, all betrayed a general
hostility against which I was powerless. It was
worse when we came to the orchestra. The executants,
seeing Habeneck’s surly manner, were cold
and reserved with me. Still they did their duty,
which he did not. He never could manage the
quick <i>tempo</i> of the saltarello; the dancers, unable to
dance to his dragging measure, complained to me.
I cried:</p>

<p>“Faster! Faster! Wake up!”</p>

<p>Habeneck, in a rage, hit his desk and broke his
bow.</p>

<p>After several exhibitions of temper of this sort I
said, calmly:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_153" id="page_153">{153}</a></span></p>

<p>“My good sir, breaking fifty bows will not prevent
your time being twice as slow as it ought to
be. This is a saltarello.”</p>

<p>He turned to the orchestra.</p>

<p>“Since it is impossible to please M. Berlioz,”
said he, “we will stop for to-day. You may go.”</p>

<p>If only I could have conducted myself! But in
France authors are not allowed to direct their own
works in theatres.</p>

<p>Years later I conducted my <i>Carnaval Romain</i>,
where that very saltarello comes in, without the
wind instruments having any rehearsal at all; and
Habeneck, certain that I should come to grief, was
present. I rushed the allegro at the proper time
and everything went perfectly.</p>

<p>The audience cried “encore,” and the second time
was even better than the first. I met Habeneck as
we went out, and threw four words at him over my
shoulder.</p>

<p>“That’s how it goes.” He did not reply.</p>

<p>I never felt so happy conducting as I did that
day; the thought of the torments Habeneck had
made me suffer increased my pleasure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But to return to <i>Benvenuto</i>.</p>

<p>Gradually the larger part of the orchestra came
over to my side, and several declared that this was
the most original score they had ever played.
Duponchel heard them and said:</p>

<p>“Was ever such a right-about face? Now they
think Berlioz’ music charming, and the idiots are
praising it up to the skies.”</p>

<p>Still some malcontents remained, and two were
found one night playing <i>J’ai du bon tabac</i> instead
of their parts.</p>

<p>It was just the same on the stage. The dancers
pinched their partners, who, by their shrieks, upset
the chorus. When, in despair, I sent for Duponchel<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_154" id="page_154">{154}</a></span>
he was never to be found; attending rehearsal was
beneath his dignity.</p>

<p>The opera came on at last. The overture made a
furore, the rest was unmercifully hissed. However
it was played three times.</p>

<p>It is fourteen years (I write in 1850) since I was
thus pilloried at the opera, and I have just read over
my poor score, carefully and impartially. I cannot
help thinking that it shows an originality, a raciness
and a brilliancy that I shall, probably, never have
again and which deserve a better fate.<a name="FNanchor_15_16" id="FNanchor_15_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_16" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><i>Benvenuto</i> took me a long time to write and would
never have been ready&mdash;tied as I was by my bread-earning
journalistic work&mdash;had it not been for the
help of a friend.</p>

<p>It was heart-breaking, and I had almost given up
the opera in despair when Ernest Legouvé came to
me, asking:</p>

<p>“Is your opera done?”</p>

<p>“First act not even ready yet. I have no time
to compose.”</p>

<p>“But supposing you had time&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I would write from dawn till dark.”</p>

<p>“How much would make you independent?”</p>

<p>“Two thousand francs.”</p>

<p>“And suppose someone&mdash;If someone&mdash;Come, do
help me out!”</p>

<p>“With what? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, suppose a friend lent it to you?”</p>

<p>“What friend could I ask for such a sum?”</p>

<p>“You needn’t ask when I offer it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Think of my relief! In real truth, next day
Legouvé lent me two thousand francs, and I finished
<i>Benvenuto</i>. His noble heart&mdash;writer and artist as he
was&mdash;guessed my trouble and feared to wound me
by his offer! I have been fortunate in having many
staunch friends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_155" id="page_155">{155}</a></span></p>

<p>Paganini was back in Paris when <i>Benvenuto</i> was
slaughtered; he felt for me deeply and said:</p>

<p>“If I were a manager I would commission that
young man to write me three operas. He should
be paid in advance, and I should make a splendid
thing by it.”</p>

<p>Mortification and the suppressed rage in which I
had lived during those everlasting rehearsals, brought
on a bad attack of bronchitis that kept me in bed,
unable to work.</p>

<p>But we had to live, and I determined to give
two concerts at the Conservatoire. The first barely
paid its expenses so, as an attraction, I advertised
the <i>Fantastique</i> and <i>Harold</i> together for the 16th
December 1838.</p>

<p>Now Paganini, although it was written at his
desire, had never heard <i>Harold</i>, and, after the
concert, as I waited&mdash;trembling, exhausted, bathed
in perspiration&mdash;he, with his little son, Achille,
appeared at the orchestra door, gesticulating violently.
Consumption of the throat, of which he
afterwards died, prevented his speaking audibly and
Achille alone could interpret his wishes.</p>

<p>He signed to the child, who climbed on a chair
and put his ear close to his father’s mouth, then
turning to me he said:</p>

<p>“Monsieur, my father orders me to tell you that
never has he been so struck by music. He wishes
to kneel and thank you.”</p>

<p>Confused and embarrassed, I could not speak, but
Paganini seized my arm, hoarsely ejaculating, “Yes!
Yes!” dragged me into the theatre where several of
my players still lingered&mdash;and there knelt and kissed
my hand.</p>

<p>Coming away in a fever from this strange scene, I
met Armand Bertin; stopping to speak to him in that
intense cold sent me home to bed worse than ever.
Next day, as I lay, ill and alone, little Achille came in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_156" id="page_156">{156}</a></span></p>

<p>“My father will be very sorry you are ill,” he
said, “if he had not been ill himself he would have
come to see you. He told me to give you this
letter.”</p>

<p>As I began to open it, the child stopped me:</p>

<p>“He said you must read it alone. There is no
answer.” And he hurried out.</p>

<p>I supposed it just a letter of congratulation; but
here it is:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;Only Berlioz can recall Beethoven,
and I, who have heard that divine work&mdash;so
worthy of your genius&mdash;beg you to accept the enclosed
20,000 francs, as a tribute of respect.&mdash;Believe
me ever, your affectionate friend,</p>

<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Niccolo Paganini</span>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Paris</span>, <i>18th Dec. 1838</i>.”</p></div>

<p>I knew enough Italian to make out the letter, but it surprised me so
greatly that my head swam, and, without thinking of what I was doing, I
opened the little note which was enclosed and addressed to M. de
Rothschild. It was in French and ran:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<span class="smcap">Monsieur le Baron</span>,&mdash;Would you be so good as to hand over the
20,000 francs that I deposited yesterday to M. Berlioz.</p>

<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Paganini.</span>”<br />
</p></div>

<p>Then I understood.</p>

<p>My wife, coming in, thought that some new trouble had fallen upon us.</p>

<p>“What is it now?” she cried. “Be brave! we have borne so much already.”</p>

<p>“No, no&mdash;not that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What then?”</p>

<p>“Paganini&mdash;has sent me&mdash;20,000 francs!”</p>

<p>“Louis! Louis!” cried Henriette, rushing for her boy, “come here to your
mother and thank God.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_157" id="page_157">{157}</a></span>”</p>

<p>And together they knelt by my bed&mdash;grateful mother and wondering child.
Oh Paganini! why could you not be there to see?</p>

<p>Naturally, my first thought was to thank him. My letter seemed so poor,
so inadequate, that I am ashamed to give it here. There are feelings
beyond words.</p>

<p>His munificent kindness was soon noised abroad and my room besieged by
friends anxious to know the facts. All rejoiced and some were
jealous&mdash;not of me, but of Paganini, who was rich enough to do such
deeds. Then began the comments, fury and lies of my opponents, followed
by the congratulatory letter of Janin and his eloquent article in the
<i>Débats</i>.</p>

<p>For a week I lay in bed, burning with impatience to see and thank my
benefactor. Then I hurried to his house and found him in the
billiard-room. We embraced in silence then, as I poured forth broken
thanks, he spoke and&mdash;thanks to the silence of the room&mdash;I was able to
make out his words.</p>

<p>“Not a word! It is so little and has given me the greatest pleasure of
my life. You cannot tell how much your music moves me. Ah!” he cried,
with a blow of his fist on the table, “now your enemies will be silenced
for they know I understand and am not easily satisfied.”</p>

<p>But great as was his name it was not great enough to silence the dogs of
Paris; in a few weeks they were again baying at my heels.</p>

<p>My earnest wish, now that all debts were paid and a handsome sum
remained in hand, was to write a masterpiece, grand, impassioned,
original, worthy of dedication to the master to whom I owed so much.</p>

<p>But Paganini, growing worse, had left for Nice, whence alas! he returned
no more. I consulted him as to a suitable theme, but he replied:</p>

<p>“I cannot advise you. You best know what suits you best.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_158" id="page_158">{158}</a></span>”</p>

<p>After much wavering I fixed on a choral symphony on Shakespeare’s <i>Romeo
and Juliet</i>, and wrote the prose words for the choral portion, which
Emile Deschamps, with his usual kindness and extraordinary versatility,
put into poetry for me.</p>

<p>Ah! the joy of no more newspaper articles!&mdash;or at least hardly any.
Paganini had given me money to make music, and I made it. For seven
months, with only a few days’ intermission, did I work at my symphony.</p>

<p>And, during those months, what a burning, exhilarating life I led! Ah!
the joy of floating on the halcyon sea of poetry; wafted onward by the
sweet soft breeze of imagination; warmed by the rays of that golden sun
of love unveiled by Shakespeare! I felt within me the god-like strength
to win my way to that blessed hidden isle, where the temple of pure art
raises its soaring columns to the sky.</p>

<p>To others must I leave it to say whether I ever truly looked upon its
glories.</p>

<p>Such as it was, my symphony was performed three times running, and each
time appeared to be a great success. To my sorrow, Paganini never heard
it nor read it. I hoped to see him again in Paris; then to send him the
printed score; but he died at Nice leaving to me the poignant sorrow
that he would never judge whether the work, undertaken to please him and
to justify his faith in its author, was worthy of his great trust.</p>

<p>He, too, seemed sorry not to have known it, and in his letter of the 7th
January 1840, he wrote:</p>

<p>“Now it is well done; jealousy can but be silent.”</p>

<p>Dear, noble friend! He never saw the ribald nonsense written about my
work; how one called my <i>Queen Mab</i> music a badly-oiled squirt, how
another&mdash;speaking of the <i>Love-Scene</i>, which musicians<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_159" id="page_159">{159}</a></span> place in the
forefront of my work&mdash;said I <i>did not understand Shakespeare</i>!</p>

<p>Empty-headed toad, bursting with stupid self-importance! If you could
prove that....</p>

<p>Never was I more deeply hurt by criticism, and yet none of these high
priests of art deigned to point out the faults, which I thankfully
corrected, when told of them.</p>

<p>For instance, Ernst’s secretary, M. Frankoski, wrote from Vienna saying
that the end of <i>Queen Mab</i> was too abrupt; I therefore wrote the
present coda and destroyed the original one.</p>

<p>The criticisms of M. d’Ortigue I also appreciated. The rest of the
alterations were my own.</p>

<p>But the symphony is enormously difficult for the executants, both in
form and style, and needs most careful, conscientious practice and
perfect conducting&mdash;which means that none but first-rate artists in each
department could possibly do it.</p>

<p>For this reason it will never be given in London. They do not give
enough time to rehearsals. The musicians there have no time for
music.<a name="FNanchor_16_17" id="FNanchor_16_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_17" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Nothing whatever. They despise music and poetry and

<p>“Hallé and Batta played Mendelssohn’s B flat sonata, then we had a
chorus over our beer, then Beethoven’s A major sonata, of which the
first movement excited us wildly, and the minuet and finale drove
us to the verge of lunacy.</p>

<p>“Oh you untiring vagabond! when will you return, once more to
preside over our nights of music?</p>

<p>“Between ourselves, you always had too many people at your
gatherings&mdash;too much talk, too little listening. You, alone, wasted
an amount of inspiration that was enough to turn one giddy, without
all the rest of the folks in addition.</p>

<p>“Do you remember that evening at Legouvé’s when&mdash;the lights put
out&mdash;you played the C sharp minor sonata, we five lying in the dark
on the floor? My tears and Legouvé’s, Schoelcher’s wondering
respect, Goubeaux’s astonishment! Ah me! you were indeed sublime
that night!</p>

<p>“But to get back to news.</p>

<p>“There is a glorious row toward between our Opera troupe and the
Italian; they want to unite them in the Rue Le Pelletier. It will
be rather a shock. Lablache against Levasseur, Rubini against
Duprez, Tamburini against Dérivis, Grisi against Mdlle. Naudin and
the whole lot against the big drum.</p>

<p>“We mean to be there to pick up the dead and the dying. Lots of
people find fault with the Opera orchestra, they say they do not
keep in tune, that the right-hand side tends to get a quarter-tone
higher than the left&mdash;which these gentlemen consider most
unreasonable&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>You seem to suffer in silence,’ one of them said to me the other
day.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>I? I did not say I suffered at all,’ I replied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_162" id="page_162">{162}</a></span> ‘First, because
I never said a word, and secondly, because....’</p>

<p>“Sometimes when they are at their wit’s end they play <i>Don
Giovanni</i>. If Mozart could come back to this world, he would tell
them (like Molière’s president) that he would not have it <i>played</i>.</p>

<p>“The other day, Ambroise Thomas, Morel, and I were saying we would
give five hundred francs for a good performance of Spontini’s
<i>Vestale</i>; that set us off&mdash;we know it by heart&mdash;and we went on
singing it till midnight.</p>

<p>“But we missed you for our accompaniments.</p>

<p>“I am just pouring out news as it comes into my head. Hiller has
sent me part of his <i>Romilda</i> from Milan. One of our enemies wished
to throw himself off the Vendome Column the other day. He gave the
keeper forty francs to let him go up&mdash;then changed his mind and
walked down again.</p>

<p>“Chopin is still away; they said he was very ill, but there is no
truth in it. Dumas has just written an exquisite
thing&mdash;<i>Mademoiselle de Belle Isle</i>&mdash;but that is out of my
province. There! no more news.</p>

<p>“My indifferentism does not extend to you and your long absence.
Come back soon. It is high time you did, both for us and, I hope,
for yourself too. Adieu.”</p></div>

<p>In 1840 the Government proposed celebrating the tenth anniversary of the
Revolution by exceptional ceremonies, and the Minister of the Interior,
M. de Remusat, who, like M. de Gasparin, had a soul for music,
commissioned me to write a symphony, leaving form and all details
entirely to me.</p>

<p>I planned a great symphony, on broad, simple lines, and as it was to be
played in the open air where delicate orchestral effects would be lost,
I engaged a military band of two hundred men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_163" id="page_163">{163}</a></span></p>

<p>Habeneck was anxious to conduct but, remembering the snuff trick, I
preferred to do my own conducting.</p>

<p>Most fortunately, I invited a large audience to the final rehearsal,
feeling sure that my work could not be properly judged on the day of
performance.</p>

<p>And so it proved. On the great Place de la Bastille, ten yards away, you
could make out nothing, and to make things worse, the legions of the
National Guard marched off right in the middle, to the rattle of fifty
kettledrums. That is the way music is always honoured in France at
public <i>fêtes</i>, apparently they think it is meant to please&mdash;the eye.</p>

<p>Towards the end of this year I made my first musical venture out of
France, as M. Snel, of Brussels, asked me to direct some of my works for
the <i>Société de la Grande Harmonie</i> in the Belgian capital.</p>

<p>Nothing but a regular <i>coup d’état</i> at home made the execution of this
plan possible. On one pretext or another, my wife had always set her
face against my leaving Paris, her real reason being a most foolish and
unfounded jealousy, for which there was absolutely no cause.</p>

<p>But constant accusations forced me, in time, to justify them and to take
advantage of the position with which she credited me.</p>

<p>Smuggling my music out of the house by degrees, I finally departed
secretly, leaving a letter of explanation and, accompanied by the lady
who has since been my constant travelling companion,<a name="FNanchor_17_18" id="FNanchor_17_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_18" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> I went off to
Brussels.</p>

<p>To cut short these sad and sordid details&mdash;after many painful scenes, an
amicable separation was arranged. I often saw my wife, my affection for
her remained unchanged&mdash;indeed, the miserable state of her health but
made her dearer to me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_164" id="page_164">{164}</a></span></p>

<p>This is sufficient to explain my conduct to those who have only known me
since that time; I shall not recur to the subject as I am distinctly not
writing confessions.</p>

<p>I gave two concerts in Brussels, where opinions were, as usual, divided
about me as in Paris. Fétis chose to find fault with my (perfectly
correct) harmony, and I was rather tempted to reply to him in one of the
papers, but finally decided to stick to my invariable rule to reply to
no criticism whatsoever.</p>

<p>This being merely a trial trip, I arranged to spend five or six months
on tour in Germany, and therefore returned straight to Paris to give a
colossal farewell concert.</p>

<p>I explained my wish to M. Pillet, director of the Opera, who was quite
willing to allow me the use of the theatre.</p>

<p>But it was necessary to keep it secret so that Habeneck might not have
time to counterplot, as he would hardly look with a favourable eye on
anyone who supplanted him at the conductor’s desk.</p>

<p>I, therefore, prepared all my music and engaged my performers without
telling them where the concert would be held, and when all was ready I
asked M. Pillet to tell Habeneck that the concert was entirely in my
hands. But he dared not face his terrible chief, and it fell to my lot
to write and inform him of our arrangements.</p>

<p>He received my letter during a rehearsal, read it several times, looked
very black, then went down to the office and said that the plan suited
him exactly, as he wished to go into the country the day of the concert.
Still his disgust was quite evident, and it was shared by a part of his
orchestra, who thought to pay court to him by shewing it.</p>

<p>The concert was for the benefit of the Opera, but I was to have five
hundred francs for my share<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_165" id="page_165">{165}</a></span> and the Opera staff were to get no extra
remuneration whatever. Mindful of my experience with the Théâtre
Italien, I determined to devote my five hundred francs to the payment of
these men, all the more readily that I felt thunder in the air in the
form of Habeneck’s savage looks, the numbers of the <i>Charivari</i> (which
cut me up tremendously) on the desks, and the constant little
confabulations that went on in odd corners.</p>

<p>I engaged six hundred performers from different theatres and from the
Conservatoire, and in a week managed to drill them into something like
order, how I cannot imagine.</p>

<p>I was on foot, baton in hand, the whole day, going from the Opera to the
Théâtre Italien, whence I engaged the chorus; thence to the Opera
Comique and to the Conservatoire to superintend different parts, for I
dared not relegate a single department to anyone else.</p>

<p>Then, in the foyer of the Opera, I took the stringed instruments from
eight till twelve, and the wind from twelve to four. My throat was on
fire, my voice gone, my right arm almost paralysed. One day I should
have been ill with thirst and fatigue had not a kind chorus-singer had
the humanity to bring me a large glass of hot wine.</p>

<p>The players of the Opera made me as much trouble as possible; they
learnt that the outside performers were to have twenty francs a piece,
so they demanded a like sum.</p>

<p>“Not for the money,” said they, “but for the honour of the Opera.”</p>

<p>“You shall have your twenty francs,” I cried; “but for heaven’s sake go
on and let me have a little peace.”</p>

<p>On the day of the grand rehearsal all went fairly well, except the
<i>Queen Mab</i> scherzo, which is too dainty to be treated by so large a
body of players.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_166" id="page_166">{166}</a></span> Unfortunately I did not think, at the time, of
entrusting it to a small band of picked musicians, so was reluctantly
obliged to cut it altogether out of the programme.</p>

<p>On the day of the performance I had hoped to keep quiet until the
evening, but my friend, Leon Gatayes, came in to tell me that a plot was
being hatched by Habeneck’s partizans (who were indignant at his being
passed over) to ruin the whole affair. The drum parchments were to be
slit, the bows of the double-basses greased, and in the middle of the
concert a section of the audience was to shout for the <i>Marseillaise</i>.</p>

<p>After this, needless to say, I did not take much rest. Prowling
restlessly round the Opera, I had the good luck to meet Habeneck; I
caught him by the arm.</p>

<p>“I hear your musicians are going to play me some tricks. I have my eye
on them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right,” he answered. “I have talked to them; you need not
be afraid.”</p>

<p>“I am not afraid: on the contrary, I am comforting <i>you</i>. You see, if
anything happened, it would fall pretty heavily on you. But make your
mind easy; they won’t do anything.”</p>

<p>And they did not. My copyist had been all day in the theatre guarding
the drum and double-basses, and I myself went round to all the desks to
ensure each man having his own part.</p>

<p>Indeed I was made quite ashamed of myself when I got to the Dauverné
brothers; one of them looked up and said reproachfully:</p>

<p>“Berlioz, surely you don’t doubt us? Aren’t we decent fellows and your
friends?”</p>

<p>I grew quite hot and stopped my investigations, for which, it must be
owned, there really was some excuse.</p>

<p>Nothing went wrong and my <i>Requiem</i> produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_167" id="page_167">{167}</a></span> its due effect, but during
the interval, according to rumour, Habeneck’s cabal howled for the
<i>Marseillaise</i>. I went to the front of the stage and shouted at the top
of my lungs:</p>

<p>“We will <i>not</i> play the <i>Marseillaise</i>; that is not what we are here
for,” and peace reigned once more.</p>

<p>Although the receipts were eight thousand five hundred francs, the sum
put aside to pay the musicians was not sufficient to fulfil my promises
to them, and I had to supplement it by three hundred and fifty out of my
own pocket, as the red ink entry in the cashier’s book at the Opera
testifies to this day.</p>

<p>Thus I organised the most tremendous concert Paris had ever known, and
was three hundred and fifty francs put of pocket for my pains. I was
likely to grow rich!</p>

<p>M. Pillet is a gentleman and I never could understand how he allowed it;
perhaps the cashier never told him.</p>

<p>I left for Germany a few days later on my pilgrimage. It was hard work
truly, but it was at least <i>musical</i> hard work, and I had the untold
happiness of being safe away from the intrigues and platitudes of Paris
and among sympathetic musical people.</p>

<h2><a name="XXVI" id="XXVI"></a>XXVI<br /><br />
<small>HECHINGEN&mdash;WEIMAR</small></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">My</span> tour began with trouble; I had intended giving a concert in Brussels,
as Madame Nathan-Treillet, the idol of the Bruxellois, had kindly
promised to come from Paris purposely to sing for me. But she fell
seriously ill, and we knew that not all the symphonies in the world
would make up for her absence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_168" id="page_168">{168}</a></span></p>

<p>When the catastrophe was announced the Grande Harmonie promptly fainted
<i>en bloc</i>, pipes went out as if from want of air, and people dispersed
groaning. In vain did I say, “Be calm! There will be no concert; you
will be spared the misery of listening to my music. Surely that
compensation is not to be despised!” It availed naught. <i>Their eyes wept
tears of beer et nolebant consolari</i> because she came not. So my concert
went to the devil.</p>

<p>Time passed; I was obliged to go on leaving the poor Belgians to their
fate. My anxiety for them, however, soon melted as I embarked on my
Rhine journey and went up to Mainz, hoping to be able to arrange a
concert there.</p>

<p>I first went to Schott, patriarch of music publishers, who seemed rather
as if he belonged to the household of the Sleeping Beauty, his somnolent
sentences being interspersed with long silences.</p>

<p>“I don’t think&mdash;you hardly will be able&mdash;give a concert&mdash;there is&mdash;no
orchestra&mdash;no public&mdash;no money.”</p>

<p>Not being overburdened with patience, I went straight to the station and
off to Frankfort. To add fuel to my fire, the train was asleep too; it
“made haste slowly”; it did not <i>go</i>; it dawdled and, particularly that
day, made interminable organ pedal-points at each station. But every
adagio has an end, and finally I got to Frankfort&mdash;a well-built, bright
town, very much alive and up to date.</p>

<p>Next day, crossing the square on my way to the theatre, I came up with
some young men carrying wind-instruments and asked them&mdash;since they
evidently belonged to the orchestra&mdash;to take my card to Guhr, the chief.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said one, who spoke French, “we are glad to see you. M. Guhr told
us you were coming. We have done <i>King Lear</i> twice, and though we cannot
offer you your Conservatoire orchestra,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_169" id="page_169">{169}</a></span> perhaps you will not be very
displeased with us.”</p>

<p>Guhr appeared, sharp, incisive, with snapping dark eyes and quick
gestures; it was easy to see that he would not err on the side of
indulgence with his orchestra. He spoke French but not fluently enough
for his wishes, so he tumbled over his sentences, which were interlarded
with oaths in a thick German accent, with most ludicrous results.</p>

<p>The upshot of his flow of eloquence was that the two Milanollo girls
were creating such a furore that no other music would have the slightest
chance of success.</p>

<p>He was voluble in excuses and ended:</p>

<p>“What can I do, my dear fellow? These infant prodigies make money;
French Vaudevilles make money&mdash;I can’t refuse money, can I? But do stay
till to-morrow and you shall hear <i>Fidelio</i> with Pischek and Mdlle.
Capitaine and you can give me your opinion of them.”</p>

<p>So it was arranged that I should go on to Stuttgart and try my fortunes
with Lindpaintner, leaving the Frankfurters to cool down after the fever
caused by the charming little sisters, whom I had praised and applauded
in Paris but who got sadly in my way in Frankfort.</p>

<p><i>Fidelio</i> was beautifully sung by Mdlle. Capitaine; she is not a
brilliant singer, but of all the women I heard in Germany I like her
best in her own style. In a box I espied my old friend, Ferdinand
Hiller, and a moment we were back on our student-comrade footing of
years before. He is at work on an oratorio <i>The Fall of Jerusalem</i>; I am
sorry that I have never been in Frankfort for one of his concerts to
hear and judge of his compositions, which I am told are of a very high
order.</p>

<p>My first care was to get as much information as I could on the musical
resources of Stuttgart, for I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_170" id="page_170">{170}</a></span> found the expenses of carrying so much
concerted music about with me something enormous and only wished to take
what I might fairly expect to be performed. I finally decided on two
symphonies, an overture and some choral pieces, leaving all the rest
with that unlucky Guhr, who seemed fated to be bothered with me and my
music in some way or other.</p>

<p>I had a letter of introduction to a Dr Schilling, whose title made me
shudder. I pictured an aged pedant in spectacles and red wig, armed with
a snuff-box and astride his hobbies, fugue and counterpoint, caring for
nothing but Bach and Marpurg and hating modern music in general and mine
in particular.</p>

<p>So much for preconceived ideas.</p>

<p>Dr Schilling was young, wore no spectacles, had a handsome crop of black
hair, smoked, took no snuff, never mentioned fugues or canons and showed
no dislike for modern music&mdash;not even mine.</p>

<p>He spoke French about as badly as I did German and our intercourse was
not precisely on the lines of Herder and Kant. I made out that I could
either apply for the loan of the theatre, which would mean freedom from
expense and ensure the presence of the King and Court or else could
engage the <i>Salle de la Redoute</i>, where I should have everything to
manage and which the King never entered.</p>

<p>I sought an interview with Baron von Topenheim, superintendent of the
theatre, who most kindly assured me that he would speak to the King that
evening:</p>

<p>“But,” he added, “I think I ought to tell you that the acoustic of the
theatre is vile and that of the <i>Salle de la Redoute</i> is good.”</p>

<p>I was nonplussed and could only go and see if Lindpaintner would advise
me what to do. I do not know how to express my feelings towards him, but
at the end of ten minutes we might have been friends of ten years’
standing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_171" id="page_171">{171}</a></span></p>

<p>“First,” said he, “do not be deceived as to the musical importance of
our town&mdash;we have neither money nor public. (I thought of Mainz and
father Schott)! But since you are here we certainly cannot let you go
without hearing some of your works, about which we are very curious. So
you must take the <i>Redoute</i> and as far as players are concerned, if you
will only give about eighty francs to their pension fund, they will
think it an honour to rehearse and to perform under your baton. Come
to-night and hear <i>Freyschütz</i> and I will introduce you and you will see
that I am right.”</p>

<p>He was as good as his word and all my fears melted away. Here was a
young, fiery, enthusiastic orchestra. I saw that from the way they
played Weber.</p>

<p>They were intrepid readers, too, nothing upset, nothing disconcerted
them, they never missed a single sign of expression either. I had chosen
the <i>Symphonie Fantastique</i> and <i>Francs-Juges</i> and trembled for my
syncopations, my four notes against three, my unusual rhythms; but they
plunged straight in without a single mistake.</p>

<p>I was astounded, for with two rehearsals the whole thing was done.</p>

<p>It would have been grand had not illness on the day of the concert taken
away half my violins and left me with four firsts and four seconds to
fight that mass of wind and percussion. It was the more harrowing, in
that the King and Court were there in full force; still it was
intelligent and sympathetic, and the audience applauded everything
warmly except the <i>Pilgrim’s March</i> from <i>Harold</i>, which fell flat. I
found it do so again when I separated it from the rest of the symphony,
which shows what a mistake it is to divide up some compositions.</p>

<p>After the concert I was congratulated by the King, by Prince Jerome
Bonaparte and by Count<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_172" id="page_172">{172}</a></span> Niepperg, but I am afraid Lindpaintner, whose
approval was more to me than all, hated everything but the overture. I
am sure Dr Schilling found it hideous and was quite ashamed of having
introduced such a musical free-lance to his quiet town.</p>

<p>However, being Councillor of State to the Prince of
Hohenzollern-Hechingen, he wrote and told His Highness of the savage he
had in tow, thinking that the said savage would find a more appropriate
setting in the wilds of the Black Forest than in civilised Stuttgart.</p>

<p>The savage therefore&mdash;receiving a cordial invitation from the Prince’s
Privy Councillor, Baron de Billing&mdash;and being avid of new sensations,
took his way through the snow and the great pine woods to the little
town of Hechingen, without in the least troubling about what he should
do when he got there.</p>

<p>I never recall this Black Forest journey without a medley of pleasant,
sad, sweet and troubled remembrances that strangely stir my heart. The
double mourning&mdash;white of the snow and black of the trees&mdash;spread over
the mountains; the cold wind’s dreary moan among the shivering, restless
pines; the ceaseless gnawing of sorrow at my heart, grown stronger in
this solitude, the bitter cold, then the arrival at Hechingen, bright
faces, gracious prince, <i>fêtes</i>, concerts, laughter, promises to meet in
Paris, then&mdash;good-bye&mdash;and once more the darkness and the cold!</p>

<p>Ah! what do I suffer even yet! What demon started me thinking of it? But
that is my way&mdash;without apparent cause, I am tormented, possessed, just
as in certain electric states of the air the leaves rustle without wind.</p>

<p>But back to Hechingen. The ruler of this minute principality was an
intellectual young man who seemed to have but two objects in life&mdash;to
make his people happy and to worship music.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_173" id="page_173">{173}</a></span></p>

<p>Can one imagine a more perfect existence?</p>

<p>His subjects adored him and music loved him, for he understood her both
as poet and musician, and had composed some touching songs.</p>

<p>He had a tiny orchestra, conducted by Täglichsbeck, whom I had met five
years earlier in Paris, and who received me with open-hearted kindness.</p>

<p>It was most amusing to see me adapting my big orchestral works to this
little band, but, by dint of patience and goodwill all round, we did
wonders and gave <i>King Lear</i>, the <i>Pilgrims’ March</i>, the <i>Ball Scene</i>,
and other excerpts in really good style.</p>

<p>Still, of course, I could not help longing for wider scope, and when the
Prince came to compliment me, I said:</p>

<p>“Ah! I would give two years of my life if Your Highness could hear that
with my Conservatoire orchestra.”</p>

<p>“Yes! yes!” he said. “I know that you have an imperial orchestra that
calls you ‘Sire,’ while I am but a Highness. I mean to go to Paris and
hear it one day&mdash;one day.”</p>

<p>After the concert we supped at his villa, and his charming brightness
infected us all. Wishing me to hear a trio he had composed for piano,
tenor, and ’cello, Täglichsbeck took the piano, the Prince the air, and
I, amid laughter and applause, tried to sing the ’cello part. My high A
simply brought down the house.</p>

<p>Two days later I returned to Stuttgart.</p>

<p>The snow was melting on the mourning pines, stained was the fair white
mantle of the mountains&mdash;all was dreary and woe-worn&mdash;again at my heart
gnawed the worm that dieth not&mdash;&mdash;</p>

wandering musician. You never have a moment’s anxiety as to
whether, when you get to a town, there will be a decent orchestra
or a theatre ready for you. To parody Louis XIV. you can say:</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Orchestra, chorus, conductor are myself.’</p>

<p>“A grand piano and a large hall are the extent of your needs. But a
poor travelling composer like myself depends upon a combination
most difficult to arrange and at any moment liable to be upset. How
much thought, precaution, fatigue it all requires. Yet look at the
reward!</p>

<p>“Think of the compensation of <i>playing on an orchestra</i>, of having
under one’s hand this vast living instrument!</p>

<p>“You <i>virtuosi</i> are princes and kings by the grace of God, you are
born on the steps of the throne; we composers must fight and
conquer before we reign. Yet the difficulties and dangers
surmounted add brilliance to our victories, and we should perhaps
be happier than you&mdash;if we always had soldiers.</p>

<p>“At Stuttgart I waited, hardly knowing what plans to make, until a
favourable answer came to my letter of enquiry addressed to Weimar.
Meanwhile I had another experience of the coldness of Germans
towards Beethoven.</p>

<p>“Lindpaintner conducted a magnificent performance of the Leonore
overture at the Redoute Society’s concert, which elicited but the
faintest applause, and I heard a gentleman say afterwards that he
wished they would give Haydn’s symphonies instead of that noisy
music without any tune in it!!!</p>

<p>“Really now, we do not own such Philistines as that in Paris!</p>

done) and Mannheim&mdash;a cold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_175" id="page_175">{175}</a></span> calm, respectable town, where love of
music will never keep the inhabitants awake.</p>

<p>“The younger Lachner, a real artist, both modest and talented, is
director there; he hurriedly arranged a concert for me, and was
deeply grieved because the ineptitude of his trombones forbade our
giving the <i>Orgie</i> in <i>Harold</i>.</p>

<p>“Mannheim bored me horribly, and it was an intense relief to get
away and breathe freely once more.</p>

<p>“Behold me then again afloat on the Rhine&mdash;I meet Guhr, still

of Weimar. Calm, luminous, peaceful, dreamy&mdash;how my heart beat as I
paced the streets!</p>

<p>“Here is the summer-house of Goethe where the late Grand Duke used
to come to take part in the discussions of Schiller, Herder, and
Wieland. There, a Latin inscription traced by the author of
<i>Faust</i>. Those two attic windows, are they indeed those of
Schiller? Was it this humble roof that sheltered the mighty
enthusiasm of the author of <i>Don Carlos</i>? Was it right of Goethe,
the rich and powerful minister, thus to leave his friend in
poverty? I fear me that it was true friendship on the side of
Schiller only&mdash;Goethe loved himself too well, he lived too long and
death was to him a terror.</p>

<p>“Schiller! Schiller! you deserved a less human friend!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_176" id="page_176">{176}</a></span></p>

<p>“It is one in the morning, with bitter cold and a brilliant moon. I
stand entranced before that small dark house; all is silent in this
city of the dead.</p>

<p>“Within me surges up that passion of respect, regret, and love for
the genius that stretches out a hand from beyond the cold dark
grave, and lays a mighty finger on us poor obscure earth wanderers,
and upon that humble threshold I kneel, murmuring brokenly,
‘Schiller! Schiller!’</p>

<p>“But I am no nearer the subject of my letter, dear friend; to
soothe myself I must think of another dweller in Weimar, the
talented but cold Hummel.</p>

<p>“That calms me; I feel better!</p>

<p>“Chélard, as Frenchman, artist, and friend, has done everything
possible to help me, and the Baron von Spiegel, the superintendent,
has most kindly offered me the theatre and orchestra. He did not
add the chorus, which was just as well, for I heard them trying to
do Marschner’s <i>Vampire</i>, and a more ghastly collection of
squallers I never heard.</p>

<p>“Of the women soloists, too, the less said the better.</p>

<p>“But are there words to describe the bass&mdash;Génast? Is he not a true
artist, a born tragedian? I wish I could have stayed long enough to
hear him in Shakespeare’s <i>King Lear</i>, which they were mounting.</p>

<p>“The orchestra is good, but, to do me special honour, Chélard and
Lobe hunted up every available extra instrument in the place; there
was no harp to be found, but a good pianist and perfect musician,
named Montag, kindly arranged my harp parts and played them on the
piano.</p>

<p>“Everyone was eagerly ready to help, and you may imagine the rare
and extreme joy of being promptly understood and followed. I will
spare you a description of the applause and recalls, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_177" id="page_177">{177}</a></span>
compliments of their Highnesses, and the many new friends who,
waiting at the stage door, bore me off and kept me till three
o’clock next morning.</p>

<p>“Where, oh where is my modesty that I retail all this? Adieu!”</p></div>

</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“On leaving Weimar, my dear Heller, my easiest
plan seemed to be to go to Leipzig, but I hesitated
because Felix Mendelssohn was musical dictator
there, and, in spite of our Roman days together, we
had since followed such divergent lines that I could
not be sure of a sympathetic reception. Chélard,
however, made me ashamed of my misgivings. I
wrote, and Mendelssohn replied so warmly and
promptly, bidding me welcome to Leipzig, that I
could not resist such an invitation, but set off at
once, regretfully leaving Weimar and my new
friends.</p>

<p>“My relations with Mendelssohn in Rome had
been rather curious. At our first meeting I had
expressed a great dislike to the first allegro in my
<i>Sardanapalus</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Do you really dislike it?’ he said, eagerly.
‘I am so glad. I was afraid you were pleased with
it, and I think it simply horrid.’</p>

<p>“Then we nearly quarrelled next day because I
spoke enthusiastically of Gluck. He said disdainfully:</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Do you like Gluck?’ as much as to say, ‘How
can a music-maker like you appreciate the majesty
of Gluck?’</p>

<p>“I took my revenge a few days after by putting on<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_178" id="page_178">{178}</a></span>
Montfort’s piano a manuscript copy of an air from
<i>Telemaco</i> without the author’s name to it. Mendelssohn
came, picked it up thinking it was a bit of
Italian opera, and began parodying it. I stopped
him in assumed astonishment, saying:</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Hallo, don’t you like Gluck?’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Gluck?’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Why yes, my dear fellow. That is Gluck, not
Bellini as you seem to think. You see I know him
better than you do, and am more of your own
opinion than you are yourself.’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

<p>“One day, speaking of the uses of the metronome,
he broke in&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>What’s the good of one? A musician who
can’t guess the time of a piece of music at sight is a
duffer.’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

<p>“I might have replied, but did not, that there were
lots of duffers. Soon after he asked to see my <i>King
Lear</i>. He read it through slowly, then, just as he
was going to play it (his talent for score-reading
was incomparable), said:</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Give me the time.’</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>What for? You said yesterday that only
duffers needed to be told the time of a piece.’</p>

<p>“He did not show it, but these home thrusts
annoyed him intensely. He never mentioned Bach
without adding ironically, ‘<i>your little pupil</i>.’ In
fact, over music he was a regular porcupine; you
could never tell where to have him. In every other
way he was perfectly charming and sweet-tempered.</p>

<p>“In Rome I learnt to appreciate the beauties of his
marvellous <i>Fingal’s Cave</i>. Often, worn out by the
scirocco and thoroughly out of sorts, I would hunt
him out and tear him away from his composition.
With perfect good humour&mdash;seeing my pitiable
state&mdash;he would lay aside his pen, and, with his
extraordinary facility in remembering intricate scores,
would play whatever I chose to name&mdash;he properly<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_179" id="page_179">{179}</a></span>
and soberly seated at the piano, I curled up in a
snappy bunch on his sofa.</p>

<p>“He liked me, with my wearied voice, to murmur
out my setting of Moore’s melodies. He always
had a certain amount of commendation for my&mdash;little
songs!</p>

<p>“After a month of this intercourse&mdash;so full of
interest for me&mdash;he disappeared without saying
good-bye, and I saw him no more.</p>

<p>“His Leipzig letter, therefore, the more agreeably
surprised me, for it showed an unexpected and
genial kindness of heart that I found to be one of
his most notable characteristics.</p>

<p>“The Concert Society has a magnificent hall&mdash;the
Gewandhaus&mdash;of which the acoustic is perfect. I
went straight to see it, and stumbled into the middle of
the final rehearsal of Mendelssohn’s <i>Walpurgis Nacht</i>.</p>

<p>“I am inclined to think<a name="FNanchor_18_19" id="FNanchor_18_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_19" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> that this is the finest thing
he has yet done, and I hardly know which to praise
most&mdash;orchestra, chorus, or the whole combined
effect.</p>

<p>“As Mendelssohn came down from his desk,
radiant with success, I went to meet him. It was
the right moment for our greetings, yet, after the
first words, the same thought struck us both&mdash;‘Twelve
years since we wandered day-dreaming in
the Campagna!’</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Are you still a jester?’ he asked.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Ah no! my joking days are past. To show
you how sober and in earnest I am, I hereby
solemnly beg a priceless gift of you.’</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>That is&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>The baton with which you conduct your new
work.’</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>By all means, if I may have yours instead?’</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>It will be copper for gold, still you shall have it.</p>

<p>“Next day came Mendelssohn’s musical sceptre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_180" id="page_180">{180}</a></span>
for which I returned my heavy oak cudgel with the
following note, which I hope would not have disgraced
the Last of the Mohicans:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Great Chief! To exchange our tomahawks
is our word given. Common is mine, plain is yours.
Squaws and Pale-faces alone love ornament. May
we be brethren, so that, when the Great Spirit calls
us to the happy hunting grounds, our warriors may
hang our tomahawks side by side in the door-way
of the Long House.’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p></div>

is my excuse for not having written sooner. I
have been, and am still, ill with fatigue, the work
involved in conducting rehearsals in both Leipzig
and Dresden is incredible.</p>

<p>“Mendelssohn is most kind, friendly, and attentive&mdash;a
master of the highest rank. I can honestly
say this in spite of his admiration for my <i>songs</i>&mdash;of
my symphonies, overtures, and <i>Requiem</i> he says
never a word!</p>

<p>“His <i>Walpurgis Nacht</i> is one of the finest
orchestral poems imaginable.</p>

<p>“Can you believe that Schumann, the taciturn,
was so electrified by my <i>Offertorium</i> that he actually
opened his mouth, and, shaking my hand, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“It really pains me to see a great master like
Mendelssohn worried with the paltry task of chorus-master.
I never cease marvelling at his patience

pleasant, and his attitude is the more appreciated
by those who, like myself, know how rare such
patience is.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_181" id="page_181">{181}</a></span></p>

<p>“I have often been accused of rudeness to the
ladies of the Opera chorus&mdash;a reputation which I
own I richly deserve&mdash;but the very minute there is
question of a choral rehearsal a sort of dull anger
takes possession of me, my throat closes up, and I
glare at the singers very much like that Gascon
who kicked an inoffensive small boy, and, when reproached
because the child had done nothing, replied:</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>But just think if he <i>had</i>!’</p>

<p>“A charming little incident concluded my Leipzig
visit. I had again been ill, and, on leaving, asked
my doctor for his account. ‘Write me the theme
of your <i>Offertorium</i>,’ he said, ‘and sign it, and I
shall be your debtor.’</p>

<p>“I hesitated, but finally did as he wished, and
then, will you believe that I missed the chance of a
charming compliment? I wrote: ‘To Dr Clarus.’</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Oh,’ said he, ‘you have added an <i>l</i> to my
name.’</p>

<p>“I thought:</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Patientibus <i>Carus</i>, sed inter doctes <i>Clarus</i>,’ and
had not the sense to say it!</p>

you&mdash;</p>

<p>“Is there a rival to Madame Schumann as a pianist?
I believe not.</p>

will not.</p>

‘there is no God but Bach, and Mendelssohn is his
prophet?’ I ought not.</p>

Lortzing’s little operas? I cannot.</p>

they think so much of here? I know not.</p>

</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“And now about Dresden. I was engaged to
give two concerts there, and found chorus, orchestra,
and a noble tenor all complete! Nowhere
else in Germany have I happened on such wealth.
Above all, I found a friend&mdash;devoted, energetic,
and enthusiastic&mdash;Charles Lipinski, whom I knew in
Paris. He so worked upon the musicians, by firing
them with ambition to do better than Leipzig, that
they were rabid for rehearsals. We had four, and
they would gladly have had a fifth had there been
time.</p>

<p>“The Dresden <i>Kapelle</i> is directed by Reissiger,
of whom we know little in Paris, and by young
Richard Wagner, who spent a long time with us,
without, however, making himself known except by
a few articles in the <i>Gazette Musicale</i>. He has
only just received his appointment, and, proud and
pleased, is doing his very best to help me.</p>

<p>“He bore endless privations in France, with the
added bitterness of obscurity, yet he returned to
Saxony and boldly wrote and composed a five-act
opera, <i>Rienzi</i>, of which the success was so great
that he followed it up with the <i>Flying Dutchman</i>.</p>

<p>“A man who could, twice over, write words and
music for an opera must be exceptionally gifted,
and the King of Saxony did well to give him the
appointment.</p>

<p>“I only heard the second part of <i>Rienzi</i>, which is
too long to be played in one evening, and I cannot,
in one hearing, pretend to know it thoroughly, but
I particularly noted a fine prayer and a triumphal
march.</p>

<p>“The score of the <i>Flying Dutchman</i> struck me by
its sombre colouring, and the clever effect of some
tempestuous motifs. But there, as in <i>Rienzi</i>, I
thought he abused the use of the <i>tremolo</i>&mdash;sign of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_183" id="page_183">{183}</a></span>
certain lazy attitude of mind against which he must
guard.</p>

<p>“In spite of that, all honour to the royal remembrance
that has saved from despair such a highly
endowed young artist.</p>

<p>“My concerts were successful, the second even
more so than the first. What the public liked best
were the <i>Requiem</i>&mdash;although we could not give the
most difficult numbers of it&mdash;and the <i>5th May Cantata</i>,
no doubt because the memory of Napoleon is as dear
to the Germans now as to us French.<a name="FNanchor_19_20" id="FNanchor_19_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_20" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>“I made the acquaintance of that wonderful
English harpist, Parish-Alvars. He is indeed the
Liszt of the harp! He produces the most extraordinary
effects, and has written a fantasia on <i>Moses</i>
that Thalberg has most happily arranged for the
piano.</p>

<p>“Why on earth does he not come to Paris?</p>

<p>“When I left Dresden to go back to Leipzig,
Lipinski heard that Mendelssohn had put the finale
of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> in rehearsal, and told me that if
he could get a holiday he should go over and hear it.</p>

<p>“I thought it was a mere compliment, but judge
of my consternation when, on the day of the concert,
he turned up. He had travelled thirty-five leagues
to hear a piece that was not given after all, because
the singer who was entrusted with Friar Lawrence’s
part refused to learn his notes!</p></div>

this, taking a leaf out of your book&mdash;inimitable satirist!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_184" id="page_184">{184}</a></span></p>

<p>“How often in our talks have I regretted that nothing would make
you serious, that nothing would stop the restless working of those
feline claws, even when you were under the delusion that they were
safely sheathed in your velvet paws&mdash;you tiger-cat!</p>

<p>“Yet look at the sensitive, delicate imagery of your writings&mdash;for
you <i>can</i> sing major when you choose; at your enthusiasm when you
let yourself go; at your tender hidden love for your old
grandmother, Germany!</p>

<p>“She, too, speaks of you with wistful tenderness; her elder sons
are dead and gone; there remains but you, whom she calls, with a
smile, her naughty boy.</p>

<p>“It would be easy for you to make splendid travesties of my
Brunswick visit, yet such is my fearless confidence in you, that to
you I mean to tell everything.</p>

<p>“That ideal family of musicians, the Müllers, received me and
arranged my concert. I counted altogether seven of them, brothers,
sons, and nephews, and never in all my travels did I see so devoted
and impassioned a set of men.</p>

<p>“As soon as they grasped the chief difficulties of my symphonies
(which they did at the first rehearsal), their progress between
each meeting was simply incredible. On my expressing surprise, I
found that they were deceiving me about the time, and that the
whole orchestra actually arrived each morning an hour before I did
to practise the intricate passages.</p>

<p>“At Zinkeisen’s request we actually dared to try <i>Queen Mab</i>, which
I had never hitherto dared do in Germany. ‘We will practise so
hard,’ said he, ‘that we <i>must</i> do it.’</p>

<p>“He did not misjudge his colleagues; my dainty little lady in her
microscopic car, drawn by humming gnats at full gallop, disported
herself with all her tricksey caprices&mdash;to the delight of the good
Brunswickers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_185" id="page_185">{185}</a></span></p>

<p>“You&mdash;own brother to fairies and will-o’-the-wisps and their chosen
poet laureate&mdash;will realise my misgivings; but never did my tiny
invisible queen glide more happily and gaily through her world of
silent harmonies.</p>

<p>“Then, in contrast, with what magnificent fury did they not seize
on the <i>Orgie</i> in <i>Harold</i>.</p>

<p>“There was something absolutely terrifying and supernatural in
their diabolic rhythm as they bounded, roared, and clashed. Ah, you
poets! No joy is yours equal to the joy of conducting!</p>

<p>“I longed to fold the whole orchestra in one comprehensive embrace,
but all I could do was cry in French&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Gentlemen, you are sublime! You are stupendous brigands!’</p>

<p>“The concert was crowded and the audience quite carried away;
hardly was the last chord struck when a frantic noise shook the
hall; it was compounded of the shouts of the listeners, the
discordant blare of the wind instruments, the tapping of bows on
the violins, and the clang of percussion instruments.</p>

<p>“At first I felt perfectly savage at this ruin to my finale, but I
calmed down when George Müller, laden with flowers, stepped forward
and said in French:</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Monsieur, allow me to offer these in the name of the Ducal
Kapelle.’</p>

<p>“The shouts and noise redoubled, my baton fell from my hand, and my
head whirled.</p>

<p>“Hardly had I left the theatre when I was invited to a supper given
in my honour by artists and amateurs. There were a hundred and
fifty guests.</p>

<p>“Toasts, speeches in French and German, to which I responded as
well as I could, then a most musical and effective hurrah was
chanted by all in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_186" id="page_186">{186}</a></span> chorus. The basses began on D, tenors on A, and
the ladies following on F♯, made up the chord of D major, to which
succeeded the sub-dominant, tonic, dominant, tonic. It was most
beautiful, most worthy of a really musical nation. Will you laugh
and call me a great simpleton for repeating all this, dear Heine? I
must candidly own that I enjoyed it.</p>

<p>“From Brunswick I journeyed on to your native city of Hamburg,
where I again had the pleasure of a crowded house and appreciative
audience, and made many friends among the orchestra. Krebs alone
was reserved in his praise. ‘My dear fellow,’ said he, ‘in a few
years your music will be all over Germany, and will be popular, and
that will be an awful misfortune! Think of the imitations, the
eccentricities, the style it will let us in for! For Art’s sake it
were better you had never been born!!’</p>

<p>“Let us hope my poor symphonies are not as contagious as he thinks.
And so, O maker of poems, adieu!”</p></div>

<p>From Hamburg I went to Berlin and Hanover, finishing at Darmstadt where
the Grand Duke insisted not only on my taking the full receipts from my
concert (so far Weimar&mdash;city of artists&mdash;was the only one that had
extended to me this courtesy) but, in addition, refused to let me pay
any of the expenses.</p>

<p>Everywhere I met with success and made friends.</p>

<p>Thus ended the longest and perhaps the most arduous pilgrimage ever
taken by a musician; its memory will, to me, be ever green.</p>

<p>How can I thank thee, Germany, noble foster-mother to the sons of music?
How express my gratitude, admiration, and regret? I know not. I can but
bow before thee humbly and murmur brokenly&mdash;</p>

<small>A COLOSSAL CONCERT</small></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">When</span> I got back to Paris, I found M. Pillet planning a revival of <i>Der
Freyschütz</i>. Now, by the rules of the Opera every word must be sung and
as there are spoken dialogues in Weber’s opera he engaged me to set them
in the form of recitations.</p>

<p>“It is all wrong,” I said, “but as that is the only condition on which
it will be played and as, if I don’t do it, you will give it to someone
who does not know Weber as I do, I accept but with one stipulation&mdash;that
you change neither music nor libretto.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” he replied, “do you suppose I would revive <i>Robin des
Bois</i>?”</p>

<p>“Very well, then I will get to work at once. How are you arranging the
parts?”</p>

<p>“Madame Stolz, Agatha; Mdlle. Dobré, Annette; Duprez, Max.”</p>

<p>“I bet he won’t take it,” I said.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“You will see soon enough.”</p>

<p>“Bouché will do well for Gaspard.”</p>

<p>“And the Hermit?”</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;well&mdash;” said he, awkwardly, “you know the Hermit isn’t much use, I
was going&mdash;to cut him out.”</p>

<p>“H’m! Really? Yet you are going to act <i>Freyschütz</i> and not <i>Robin des
Bois</i>. Evidently, since we sha’n’t agree, it is better for me to retire
at once for I can’t stand that sort of correction.”</p>

<p>“Dear me! how wholesale you are in your notions. Very well, we will keep
the Hermit, we will keep everything, lock, stock, and barrel.”</p>

<p>Then my troubles began. The actors would make their recitations as slow
and stately as a tragedy; Duprez,&mdash;as I foretold&mdash;although ten years<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_188" id="page_188">{188}</a></span>
before he had been a light tenor and had managed Max perfectly&mdash;found it
impossible to adapt his fine tenor voice to the music and demanded all
sorts of unheard-of transpositions and alterations. I cut them short by
refusing to disintegrate the rôle and it was handed over to Marié.</p>

<p>Then nothing would do but they must have a ballet, and as I could not
stop it I tried to arrange a sort of scene from Weber’s <i>Invitation to
the Waltz</i>; but that was not enough, so the dancers themselves took it
into their heads that some bits out of my symphonies would come in
nicely.</p>

<p>Pillet agreed. I did not; and, to stop discussion, I said:</p>

<p>“Now look here! I entirely object to introducing into <i>Der Freyschütz</i>
music that is not Weber’s. To prove that I am not unreasonable, go and
ask Dessauer, who is over there; I will abide by his decision.”</p>

<p>At Pillet’s first words Dessauer turned sharply to me:</p>

<p>“Oh, Berlioz! don’t do that!”</p>

<p>That ended the matter for the time and the opera was a success. But when
I went to Russia they cut and chopped and gnawed it until it was simply
a deformity.</p>

<p>And <i>how</i> they play what is left now! What a conductor! What a chorus!
What utterly sleepy, disgraceful ineptitude and misinterpretation of
everything by everybody!</p>

<p>When will a new Christ come to purge our temple and drive out the money
changers with a scourge!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I returned to my treadmill&mdash;journalism&mdash;once more, and oh! the horror of
it!</p>

<p>The misery of writing to order an article on nothing in particular&mdash;or
on things that, as far as I was concerned, simply did not exist since
they excited in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_189" id="page_189">{189}</a></span> me no feeling of any description whatsoever. Long ago I
remember spending three days over a critique without being able to write
one word. I cannot remember the subject but I well remember my torments.</p>

<p>I strode up and down, my brain on fire; I gazed at the setting sun, the
neighbouring gardens, the heights of Montmartre&mdash;my thoughts a thousand
miles away.</p>

<p>Then, as I turned and saw that confounded white paper without a line on
it, I flew into the wildest rage.</p>

<p>My unoffending guitar leant against the wall. I kicked it to bits; my
pistols stared at me from the wall with big round eyes. I gazed back,
then, tearing my hair, burst into burning tears.</p>

<p>That soothed me somewhat, I turned those staring pistols face to the
wall and picked up my poor guitar which gave forth a plaintive wail.
Then my six-year-old boy, with whom I had unjustly found fault, tapped
at the door. As I did not answer he cried:</p>

<p>“Father, is you friends?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, my boy, I is friends!” and I flew to let him in. I took him
on my knee and laid his fair head on my shoulder; we dropped asleep
together and my article was forgotten. Next morning I managed to write
something. That is fifteen years ago and my martyrdom still lasts! It is
not that I mind work. I can grind at rehearsals for hours at a time; can
spend my nights in correcting proofs; can and will do anything and
everything that pertains to my work as a musician.</p>

<p>But to eternally pamphleteer for a living! It is cruel!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<i>3rd October 1844.</i>&mdash;I read in the <i>Débats</i> of your
splendid agricultural success and can imagine how<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_190" id="page_190">{190}</a></span>
much work and perseverance it involves. You are a
kind of Robinson Crusoe in your island,<a name="FNanchor_20_21" id="FNanchor_20_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_21" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and when
the sun shines I long to be with you, to breathe the
spicy air, to follow you from field to field, to listen
with you to the sweet silence of your lonely groves&mdash;our
affection is so sure, so whole-hearted, so perfect!</p>

<p>“Yet when dull days come and mists rise, the fever
of Paris seizes me once more and I feel that here only
is life possible. But can you believe that a strange
sort of torpid resignation with regard to things
musical has taken possession of me? It is as well,
for this indifference saves my strength for the time
when a passionate struggle may become necessary.</p>

<p>“You have doubtless heard of the marvellous
success of my <i>Requiem</i> in St Petersburg. Romberg
most bravely tackled the enormous expense and,
thanks to the generosity of the Russian aristocracy,
made a profit of five thousand francs. Give me a
despotic government as nursing mother of Art!</p>

<p>“If you could but be here this winter! I long to
see you. I seem to be going down hill so rapidly,
life is so short! The end is often before my eyes
now and I clutch with frenzied eagerness at the
flowers beside my path as I slip quickly past.</p>

<p>“There was a rumour that I was to succeed
Habeneck at the Opera, it is a dictatorship that I
should enjoy in the interests of Art. But, for that,
Habeneck would have to be translated to the Conservatoire,
where Cherubini still goes to sleep.
Perhaps when I am old and incapable I shall go to
the Conservatoire. At present I am too young to
dream of it!”</p></div>

<p>I was railing more than usual at my hard fate
when Strauss proposed that we should give a concert
at the close of the 1844 Exhibition, in the
empty building.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_191" id="page_191">{191}</a></span></p>

<p>It was a tremendous undertaking, for his original
intention was to have also a ball and a banquet to
the exhibitors. But, owing to the fixed idea of M.
Delessert, chief of the police, that plots and risings
were in the air, we were forced to reduce it to a
classical concert for me and a popular promenade
concert next day for Strauss.</p>

<p>Rushing all over Paris I engaged nearly every
musician of any consequence and gathered a body
of 1022 performers&mdash;all paid except the singers
from the lyric theatres, who helped me for love of
music.</p>

<p>The rehearsals and general arrangements were
most arduous and my anxiety lest we should fail
nearly killed me. The great day, the 1st August,
came and at noon (the concert began at one o’clock)
I went to the Exhibition, noticing with pleasure the
stream of carriages all converging on the Champs
Elysées. Everything inside the building was in
perfect order, everyone in his or her appointed place,
and my good friend and indefatigable librarian, M.
Rocquemont, assured me that all would go perfectly.</p>

<p>Musical delirium seized me, I thought no more
of public, receipts or deficit, but was just raising my
baton to begin when a violent smashing of wood
announced that the people had burst the barriers
and filled the hall. This meant success and I joyfully
tapped my desk, crying:</p>

<p>“Saved!”</p>

<p>To direct my mass of performers I had Tilmant
to conduct the wind, Morel<a name="FNanchor_21_22" id="FNanchor_21_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_22" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> the percussion instruments,
and five chorus-masters, one in the centre and
four at the corners to guide those singers who were
out of my range. Thus there were seven deputy-conductors,
whose arms rose and fell with mine
with incredible precision.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_192" id="page_192">{192}</a></span></p>

<p>The Blessing of the Daggers from the <i>Huguenots</i>
was given with an imposing effect that surpassed my
expectations. I wished Meyerbeer could have
heard it. It worked upon me so that my teeth
chattered and I shook with nervous ague. The
concert had to be stopped while they brought me
some punch and a change of clothes, and by making
a little screen of the harps in their linen covers, I
was enabled to dress right before the audience
without being seen.</p>

<p>The concert finished triumphantly with the utmost
satisfaction to artists and audience but, as I went
out, I had the gruesome pleasure of seeing the
hospital authorities counting our receipts and walking
off with the <i>eighth gross</i>&mdash;that is, four thousand
francs&mdash;which left me, when all was paid, with
eight hundred francs for all my trouble and anxiety.</p>

<p>This mad experiment was hardly over when M.
Amussat, my anatomy master and friend, called.</p>

<p>“Why, Berlioz!” he said, “what on earth is the
matter? You are as yellow as a guinea and look
thoroughly overdone.”</p>

<p>He felt my pulse.</p>

<p>“You are on the verge of typhoid and must
be bled.”</p>

<p>“Very well, do it now.”</p>

<p>He did, and then said:</p>

<p>“You will please leave Paris at once and go to
the Riviera or somewhere south by the sea and forget
all these exciting topics. Be off at once.”</p>

<p>With my eight hundred francs I went to Nice.
It moved me strangely to see those haunts of thirteen
years earlier&mdash;the days of my youth.</p>

<p>I bathed, explored the well-known cliffs, paid
my respects to the old cannon, still asleep in the
sun; the room in which I wrote <i>King Lear</i> was let
to an English family so I found shelter in an old
tower adjoining the Ponchettes Rocks. After a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_193" id="page_193">{193}</a></span>
month’s lotus-eating I turned my face once more to
Paris and took up again my Sisyphus burden.</p>

<p>After giving some concerts in the circus of the
Champs Elysées, which fatigued me greatly I again
took a rest on the Mediterranean shores then gave
some more concerts in Marseilles, Lyons and Lille
of which I have given a full account in my <i>Grotesques
de la Musique</i>. Shortly afterwards I started on my
tour through Austria, Bohemia and Hungary.</p>

<h2><a name="XXIX" id="XXIX"></a>XXIX<br /><br />
<small>THE RAKOCZY MARCH</small></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Of</span> my journey from Paris to Vienna I only have
two distinct impressions&mdash;one of a violent pain in my
side that I thought would be the death of me and
the other of a species of god I saw at Augsbourg.
This worthy man had founded a sort of neo-christianity
which was rather popular: he looked a decent
sort of fellow.</p>

<p>At Ratisbon the steamer had gone, so I was obliged
to wait two days and then go on in a diligence,
which made me feel as if I had gone back into the
Dark Ages. At Linz, however, I set foot on a fine
steam-boat, and found myself once more in <small>A.D.</small>
1845.</p>

<p>But I had time for reflection and could not help
wondering why on earth we cannot all spell the
names of places alike. There was I, hunting through
a German map. Linz was graciously pleased to
be the same in both languages, but where was
Ratisbon? Who could possibly find it masquerading
as Regensburg?</p>

<p>What should we say to the Germans if they persisted
in calling Lyons, Mittenberg, and Paris, Triffenstein?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_194" id="page_194">{194}</a></span></p>

<p>On landing at Vienna I at once got an idea of
the passion for music of the Austrians.</p>

<p>The custom-house officer examining my trunks
caught sight of the name on them and asked:</p>

<p>“Where is he? Where is he?”</p>

<p>“I am he, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“<i>Mein Gott</i>, M. Berlioz, where in the world have
you been? We have been waiting for you a week
and couldn’t think what had become of you.”</p>

<p>I thanked my worthy friend as well as my
limited vocabulary would allow, and could not help
thinking that my non-appearance would never give
rise to similar anxiety at the Paris Douane.</p>

<p>The first concert I went to was one in the Riding
School, given by nearly a thousand performers&mdash;most
of them amateurs&mdash;for the benefit of the Conservatoire,
which has no, or very little, Government
support. The verve and precision with which that
musical crowd rendered Mozart’s delicate <i>Flauto
Magico</i> overture quite astonished me, I had not
believed it possible.</p>

<p>I was delighted to make the acquaintance of
Nicolaï, conductor of the Kärnthnerthor Theatre;
he has the three gifts necessary&mdash;to my mind&mdash;for a
perfect director. He is an experienced, enthusiastic
composer, has perfect intuition for rhythms and
clear-cut and precise mechanism. Finally, he is a
clever organiser, sparing neither time nor trouble;
hence the wonderful unity and perfection of the
Kärnthnerthor orchestra.</p>

<p>He arranged sacred concerts in the <i>Salle des Redoutes</i>
similar to ours in Paris. There I heard a
scena from <i>Oberon</i>, a fine symphony of Nicolaï’s
own and the incomparable B flat of Beethoven.</p>

<p>It is in this fine hall that, thirty years since,
Beethoven gave his masterpieces&mdash;now worshipped
by Europe, but then despised by the Viennese, who
crowded to hear Salieri’s operas! How my knees<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_195" id="page_195">{195}</a></span>
trembled as I stood at the desk where once <i>he</i> had
stood! Nothing is changed; the desk I used is
the very one that he had used, by that staircase he
had come up to receive the applause of his few
admirers, looked upon by the rest of the audience
as fanatics in search of eccentricity.</p>

<p>For recognition Beethoven had to wait, but how
he suffered!</p>

<p>To my great delight Pischek, the splendid baritone
I had met and admired in Frankfort, suggested
that he should make his Viennese début at my
concert.</p>

<p>He had improved immensely; somehow his voice
always gave rise in me to a sort of exaltation
or intoxication which, now, was intensified by its
splendid compass, passion and exquisite sweetness.</p>

<p>No wonder that his success in a great ballad
by Uhland (which bore no resemblance to the inanities
we call ballads in Paris) was instantaneous
and, as an encore, he gave a song that drove the
audience almost frantic. If only he would learn
French what a furore he would make in Paris!</p>

<p>My reception by all in Vienna&mdash;even by my
fellow-ploughmen, the critics&mdash;was most cordial;
they treated me as a man and a brother, for which
I am heartily grateful.</p>

<p>After my third concert at a grand supper my
friends presented me with a silver-gilt baton, and
the Emperor sent me eleven hundred francs with the
rather odd compliment, “Tell Berlioz I was really
amused.”</p>

<p>The rest of my doings, are they not written in
the newspapers of the day?</p>

<p>The first thing I did on leaving Vienna for Pesth
was to get into trouble with the Danube, which,
instead of remaining decently within its banks, chose
to overflow and inundate that muddy Slough of
Despond by courtesy called the Emperor’s high<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_196" id="page_196">{196}</a></span>way.
Only with an extra team of horses had we
been able to make way even so far, but at midnight
I was aroused from my resigned drowsiness by the
stoppage of the carriage and the boiling of waters
all round.</p>

<p>The driver had gone straight into the river, and
dared not stir a step. The water rose steadily.</p>

<p>There was a Hungarian captain in the coupé who
had spoken to me once or twice through the little
window between us; it was my turn to speak now:</p>

<p>“Captain!”</p>

<p>“Sir?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think we are going to be drowned?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. Have a cigar.”</p>

<p>His calm insolent coolness made me long to smash
his head in; in a fury I took his cigar and puffed
violently. Still the water rose and the desperate
driver turned, and at the risk of spilling us all in
the river, climbed up the bank and took us straight-way&mdash;into
a lake. This time I thought must be
the end of all and I called out to the soldier:</p>

<p>“Captain, have you another cigar?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Let me have it quick, for it’s all up with us now!”</p>

<p>But it was not, for an honest country man passing
by (where the devil could he have been going
in such weather at such a time of night?) extricated
us and gave our unhappy Phæton directions
whereby we made our way to Pesth. At least it was
a big town of which I asked my captain the name.</p>

<p>“Buda,” said he.</p>

<p>“What? In my map the town opposite Pesth
is called Ofen. Look.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, that’s Buda. Ofen is the German name
for it.”</p>

<p>“H’m, I see. German maps are as cleverly
arranged as French ones; but I think they might
give us both names anyway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_197" id="page_197">{197}</a></span>”</p>

<p>On reaching Pesth I had a little pleasure party all
to myself, in accordance with a promise made to
myself while soaking in the Danube mud. I took
a bath, drank two glasses of Tokay and slept twenty
hours&mdash;not, however, without visions of boiling
waters and lakes of mud. After which I set out on
the war-path of concert-promoting, greatly helped by
the kindness of Count Raday, superintendent of the
National Theatre.</p>

<p>Now the Hungarians are nothing if not patriotic.
In every shop window things are ticketed <i>hony</i>
(national) and, by the advice of an amateur in
Vienna, who had brought me a volume of Hungarian
national airs, I chose the Rakoczy March and
arranged it as it now stands as finale to the first
part of my <i>Faust</i>.</p>

<p>No sooner did the rumour spread that I had
written <i>hony</i> music than Pesth began to ferment.</p>

<p>How had I treated it? They feared profanation
of that idolised melody, which for so many years
had made their hearts beat with lust of glory and
battle and liberty; all kinds of stories were rife,
and at last there came to me M. Horwath, editor
of a Hungarian paper&mdash;who, unable to curb his
curiosity, had gone to inspect my march at the
copyist’s.</p>

<p>“I have seen your Rakoczy score,” he said, uneasily.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Well; I feel horribly nervous about it.”</p>

<p>“Bah! why?”</p>

<p>“Your motif is introduced <i>piano</i>, and we are used
to hearing it started <i>fortissimo</i>.”</p>

<p>“Yes, by the gipsies. Is that all? Don’t be
alarmed. You shall have such a forte as you never
heard in your life. You can’t have read the score
carefully; remember the end is everything.”</p>

<p>All the same, when the day came my throat<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_198" id="page_198">{198}</a></span>
tightened, as it did in times of great excitement,
when this devil of a thing came on. First the
trumpets gave out the rhythm, then the flutes and
clarinets, with a <i>pizzicato</i> accompaniment of strings&mdash;softly
outlining the air&mdash;the audience remaining
calm and judicial. Then, as there came a long
<i>crescendo</i>, broken by the dull beats of the big drum
(as of distant cannon) a strange restless movement
was perceptible among them&mdash;and, as the orchestra
let itself go in a cataclysm of sweeping fury and
thunder, they could contain themselves no longer.</p>

<p>Their overcharged souls burst with a tremendous
explosion of feeling that raised my hair with terror.</p>

<p>I lost all hope of making the end audible,<a name="FNanchor_22_23" id="FNanchor_22_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_23" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and in
the encore it was no better; hardly could they contain
themselves long enough to hear a portion of the
coda.</p>

<p>Horwath, in his box, was like one possessed, and
I could not resist a smiling glance at him to ask&mdash;</p>

<p>“Are you still afraid or are you content with
your <i>forte</i>?”</p>

<p>It was lucky that this was the end of the programme,
for certainly these excitable people would
have listened to nothing more.</p>

<p>As I mopped my face in the little room set apart
for me, a poorly dressed man slipped quietly in. He
threw himself upon me, his eyes full of tears, and
stammered out:</p>

<p>“Ah, monsieur&mdash;the Hungarian&mdash;poor man&mdash;not
speak French&mdash;Forgive, excited&mdash;understood your
cannon&mdash;Yes, big battle&mdash;Dogs of Germans!”
Striking his chest vehemently&mdash;“In heart of me you
stay&mdash;ah, French&mdash;Republican&mdash;know to make music
of Revolution!”</p>

<p>I cannot describe his frenzy; it was almost sublime.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_199" id="page_199">{199}</a></span></p>

<p>After that, of course, the Rakoczy ended every
concert, and on leaving I had to present the town
with my MS.</p>

<p>Later on I sent them a revised version, as some
young Hungarians did me the honour to present me
with a silver crown of most exquisite workmanship.</p>

<p>When I got back to Vienna, the amateur who had
given me the idea of writing the march came to me
in comical terror.</p>

<p>“For mercy’s sake,” he begged, “never tell that I
gave you the idea. The excitement of it has reached
Vienna, and I should get into dreadful trouble if it
were known.”</p>

<p>Of course I promised silence, but, as this terrible
affair is long since done with, I may now add that
he was called&mdash;&mdash; No, I only wished to frighten
him. I won’t tell!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had not intended to include Prague in my round,
but someone sent me the Prague <i>Musical Gazette</i>
with three appreciative articles on my <i>King Lear</i> by
Dr Ambros. I wrote to thank him and mentioned
my doubts of my reception by his fellow-citizens
who, I had been told, would hear no one but Mozart.
His kind reply swept away my misgivings and made
me as eager to go as I had hitherto been the reverse.
Of Prague my recollections are golden. I gave six
concerts, and at the last, had the great joy of having
Liszt to hear my <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>.</p>

<p>At the close of the performance as I begged him
to be my interpreter in thanking the artists for their
devotion and patience in spending three weeks over
my works, two or three of them came up to us and
spoke to him.</p>

<p>“My office is changed,” he said, turning to me;
“these gentlemen request me to convey to you their
thanks for the pleasure you have given them and
their joy in your pleasure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_200" id="page_200">{200}</a></span>”</p>

<p>This was indeed a red-letter day for me! There
are not many such in my life.</p>

<p>As the music lovers of Vienna had given me a
banquet and a silver-gilt baton, those of Prague gave
me a supper and a silver cup.</p>

<p>But this same cup poured out such floods of
champagne that Liszt, who had made a charming
and touching speech in my honour, was shipwrecked
therein. At two o’clock in the morning Belloni,
his secretary, and I were hard at work in the streets
of Prague trying to persuade him to wait till daylight
to fight a Bohemian who had drunk more than
he had. We were rather anxious about him, as he
had to give a concert at noon next day, and at half-past
eleven was still asleep. At length he was
awakened, jumped into a carriage, walked on to the
platform, and played as I verily believe he had never
played before. There certainly is a Providence over&mdash;pianists.</p>

<p>I cannot express my tender regrets for those good
Bohemians.</p>

<small>PARIS&mdash;RUSSIA&mdash;LONDON</small></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">While</span> trailing round Germany in my old post-chaise I composed my
<i>Damnation de Faust</i>. Each movement is punctuated by memories of the
place where it was written. For instance, the Peasant’s Dance was
written by the light of a shop gas-jet one night when I had lost myself
in Pesth, and I got up in the middle of the night in Prague to write the
song of the angelic choir.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_201" id="page_201">{201}</a></span></p>

<p>Thinking that my foreign tour might have enhanced my home reputation, on
my return to Paris I ventured to put it in rehearsal, going to enormous
expense for copying and for the hire of the Opera Comique. Fatal
reasoning! The indifference of the Parisians to art had increased by
leaps and bounds, the weather in November 1846 was vile, and they
preferred their warm homes to the unfashionable Opera Comique.</p>

<p>It was twice performed to half empty houses and elicited no more
attention than if I had been the least of Conservatoire students.
Nothing in all my career has wounded me as this did. The lesson was
cruel but useful; I vowed that never again would I trust to the tender
mercies of Paris.</p>

<p>I did not keep my vow, for later on I could not resist letting it hear
my <i>Childhood of Christ</i>, which proved a great success.</p>

<p>[Berlioz does not mention the domestic troubles that added greatly to
his dejection. His wife was paralysed and his son Louis, brought up in a
divided household, naturally gave him anxiety, as the following letter
shows]:</p>

<p class="c">
<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Louis Berlioz</span>.<br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<i>October 1846.</i>&mdash;Your mother is a little better,
but she is still in bed and unable to speak. As the
least agitation would be fatal to her, do not write to
her as you have done to me.</p>

<p>“You talk of being a sailor. Do you wish to
leave me? for, once at sea, God knows when I shall
see you again. Were I but free I would go with
you, and we would seek our fortunes in India or
some far-off land, but to travel one must have money,
and only in France can I get my living&mdash;such as
it is.</p>

<p>“I am speaking to you as if you were grown up.
You must think over what I say and you will under<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_202" id="page_202">{202}</a></span>stand.
But remember that, whatever happens, I am
and always shall be your best and most devoted
friend. It would indeed be sad if, when you came
to be twenty years of age, you found yourself useless
both to society and yourself. Good-bye, dear
child. My heartfelt love.”</p></div>

<p><i>Faust</i> was my ruin. After two days of unutterable
misery I decided to retrieve my fortunes by a
tour in Russia, if I could but collect enough money
first to pay my debts. Then did my kind friends
rally round me and apply healing balm to my
wounded spirit.</p>

<p>M. Berlin advanced me a thousand francs from
the <i>Débats</i> funds; one friend lent me five hundred,
others six or seven; M. Friedland, a young German
I had met in Prague, twelve hundred, and Hetzel a
thousand.</p>

<p>So, helped on all sides, I was able, with a clear
conscience, to leave for Russia on the 14th February
1847, feeling that few men have been so blessed as
I in the devoted generosity and kind-heartedness of
my single-minded friends.</p>

<p>The time for concert-giving in Russia is Lent&mdash;March&mdash;as
then the theatres are all closed. The
cold was intense, and during my whole fortnight’s
journey I never lost sight of the snow, and made
only one short stop in Berlin to beg a letter of introduction
to the Empress of Russia from her brother,
the King of Prussia, which, with his invariable
kindness, he sent me at once.</p>

<p>Before leaving Paris, Balzac said to me:</p>

<p>“Be sure at Tilsit to hunt up the post-master,
M. Nernst. He is a clever, well-read man and may
be useful to you.”</p>

<p>So at Tilsit I walked into his office and there
found a big man perched on a high stool.</p>

<p>“M. Nernst?” I said, taking off my hat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_203" id="page_203">{203}</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur; to whom have I the honour of
speaking?”</p>

<p>“To Hector Berlioz.”</p>

<p>“No! not really?” He bounced off his stool
and landed before me, cap in hand.</p>

<p>How well I remember my poor father’s happy
pride in this story! “Not really?” he would repeat,
and his laughter would ring out again and again.</p>

<p>We had a cordial meeting-ground in our mutual
friendship with Balzac, and after some hours’ rest
I set out, warmed and comforted, in a horrible iron
sledge wherein I endured a martyrdom till, four
days later, I reached St Petersburg.</p>

<p>Hardly had I shaken off the traces of my journey
when M. Lenz, an old acquaintance, came to take
me to Count Michael Wielhorski, from whom I
received a most flattering welcome. He and his
brother, by their love of art, their great connections
and immense fortune, have made their palace a sort
of little Ministry of Fine Arts.</p>

<p>By them I was introduced to Romberg, General
Guédéonoff, superintendent of the Imperial theatres,
and General Lwoff, aide-de-camp to the Emperor,
a composer of rare talent.</p>

<p>Not to go into too many details, my visits both
to St Petersburg and Moscow were the greatest
success financially as well as artistically. My first
concert (at which I was summoned, hot and dishevelled
with my exertions, to the box of the
Emperor, who was most gracious) made eighteen
thousand francs; the expenses were six thousand,
the balance was mine.</p>

<p>I could not resist murmuring, as I turned to the
south-west, “Ah, dear Parisians!”</p>

<p>I must just recall one of my red-letter days&mdash;the
performance of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> in St Petersburg.</p>

<p>No wretched bargaining, no limitation of rehearsals
here!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_204" id="page_204">{204}</a></span></p>

<p>I asked General Guédéonoff:</p>

<p>“How many rehearsals can your Excellency allow
me?”</p>

<p>“How many? Why! as many as you want.
They will rehearse until you are satisfied.”</p>

<p>And they did; consequently it was royally,
imperially, organised and performed.</p>

<p>The vast theatre was full; diamonds, uniforms,
helmets shone and glittered everywhere. I, too,
was in good form, and conducted without a single
mistake&mdash;a thing that, in those days, did not happen
often.</p>

<p>I was recalled more times than I could count, but
I must own that I paid small heed to the public,
the divine Shakespearean poem that I myself had
made affected me so deeply that, the moment I
was free, I fled to a quiet room in the theatre,
where my dear, good Ernst found me in floods of
tears.</p>

<p>“Ah! nerves!” said he, “I know too well what
it is.”</p>

<p>And, holding my head, he let me sob like a
hysterical girl for a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>Despite its warm reception, I doubt that my
symphony was rather over the heads of the audience,
therefore, when it was to be repeated, on the advice
of the cashier of the theatre, I added two scenes
from <i>Faust</i>.</p>

<p>I heard of a funny incident at this second performance.
One lady present sat and was bored with
most exemplary patience; she would not have it
thought that she could not understand this feast of
music. Proud of having stayed to the end, she said,
as she left her box:</p>

<p>“Yes, it is a tremendous thing, but quite intelligible.
In that grand introduction I could
absolutely <i>see Romeo driving up in his gig</i>!!!”</p>

<p>I spoke of Ernst just now&mdash;great artist and noble<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_205" id="page_205">{205}</a></span>
friend. He has been compared to Chopin&mdash;a comparison
both true and false.</p>

<p>Chopin could never bear the restraints of time,
and, I think, carried his independence too far;
he simply <i>could not</i> play in time. Ernst, while employing
<i>rubato</i>, kept it within artistic limits, retaining
always a dignified sway over his own caprices.</p>

<p>In Chopin’s compositions all the interest centres in
the piano, his orchestral concerto accompaniments
are cold and practically useless. Ernst is distinguished
by quite the opposite&mdash;his concerted music
is not only brilliant for the solo instrument, but
the symphonic interest is thoroughly grateful and
sustained.</p>

<p>Even Beethoven allowed the orchestra to overpower
the soloist, and, to my mind, the perfect system is
that adopted by Ernst, Vieuxtemps and Liszt.</p>

<p>Chopin was the delicate refined virtuoso of small
gatherings, of groups of intimate friends. Ernst
was master of crowds; he loved them, and, like
Liszt, was at his very best with two thousand
hearers to conquer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Great Feast being over, there was nothing
to keep me in St Petersburg, which, however, I left
with great regret.</p>

<p>Passing through Riga, I thought I would give a
concert. The receipts hardly covered the expenses
(I think I was twelve francs to the good), but it
procured me the friendship of some pleasant artists
and amateurs, amongst them the post-master, who
turned out to be a constant reader of my newspaper
articles. He looked me dubiously up and down,
and said:</p>

<p>“You don’t <i>look</i> a firebrand, but from your articles
I should have expected quite a different sort of man,
for, devil take me! you write with a dagger, not a
pen!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_206" id="page_206">{206}</a></span>”</p>

<p>The King of Prussia wishing to hear my <i>Faust</i>, I
arranged to stay ten days in Berlin. The Opera
House was placed at my disposal, and I was promised
half the gross receipts. The orchestra and choruses
were capital, but I cannot say as much for the
soloists, who were feeble in the extreme. The
King of Thule ballad was hissed, but whether this
was due to me or to the singer I cannot say&mdash;probably
both&mdash;for the stalls were filled with a malicious
crowd who objected to a Frenchman having the
audacity to set to music a German classic.</p>

<p>However, by the time we got to the <i>Danse des
Sylphes</i> I was in a bad temper and refused the encore
they gave it.</p>

<p>The royalties were apparently satisfied; the
Princess of Prussia said many nice things and the
King sent me the Red Eagle by Meyerbeer and
invited me to dinner at Sans Souci. I met with a
cordial reception, gave him news of his sister in
Russia and finally ventured to say after dinner was
over: “Ah, sire, you are the true king of artists.
Without you could Spontini and Meyerbeer have
gained a hearing? Was it not at your suggestion
that Mendelssohn composed his <i>Antigone</i> music?
Did not you commission him to write the <i>Midsummer
Night’s Dream</i>? Does not your known love of art
incite us all to do our best?”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps so,” he answered, “but there’s
no need to say so much about it.”</p>

<p>But it is true. Now there are two other sovereigns
who share his interest&mdash;the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar
and the blind young King of Hanover.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On returning to France I took my boy to see his
relations at La Côte Saint-André. Poor Louis! how
happy he was; petted by relations and old servants
and wandering about the fields, his little hand thrust
in mine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_207" id="page_207">{207}</a></span></p>

<p>In a letter I had yesterday he says that that fortnight
was the happiest of his life. And now he is
at the blockade of the Baltic, on the eve of a naval
battle&mdash;that hell upon the sea! The mere thought
of it maddens me; yet he chose it himself&mdash;this
noble profession. But we did not expect war then.</p>

<p>Dear noble boy! at this minute they may be
bombarding Bomarsund&mdash;it will not bear thinking of,
I must turn to other things&mdash;I can write no more.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>From Paris and its usual weary round of jealousy
and intrigue, it was a comfort to turn to London,
whence I received the offer of an engagement to
conduct the grand English Opera for Jullien. In
his usual rôle of madman he got together orchestra,
chorus, principals and theatre, merely forgetting a
repertoire. To cover expenses he would have had
to take ten thousand francs a night and this he expected
to net out of an English version of <i>Lucia di
Lammermoor</i>!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<span class="smcap">London</span>, <i>November 1847</i>.&mdash;Dear Rogé,&mdash;Your
letter should have been answered sooner had it not
been for the thousand and one worries that overwhelmed
me the minute I set foot in Paris.</p>

<p>“You can have no idea of my existence in that
infernal city that thinks itself the home of Art.</p>

<p>“Thank heaven I have escaped to England and
am, financially, more independent than I dared to
hope.</p>

<p>“Jullien, the manager here, is a most intrepid
spirit and seems to understand English people; he
has made his fortune and is going to make mine, he
says. I let him have his own way since he does
nothing unworthy of art and good taste&mdash;but I have
my doubts.</p>

<p>“I have come <i>alone</i> to London; you may guess<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_208" id="page_208">{208}</a></span>
my reasons. I badly needed a little freedom which,
so far, I have never been able to get. Not one <i>coup
d’état</i> but a whole series was necessary before I
succeeded in shaking off my bonds. Yet now,
although I am so busy with rehearsals, my loneliness
seems very odd.</p>

<p>“Since I am in a confidential mood, will you
believe that I had a queer little love affair in St
Petersburg with a girl&mdash;now don’t laugh like a full
orchestra in C major! It was poetic, heart-rending,
and perfectly innocent.</p>

<p>“Oh, our walks! oh, the tears I shed when, like
Faust’s Marguerite, she said: ‘What can you see in
me&mdash;a poor girl so far beneath you?’ I thought I
should die of despair when I left St Petersburg, and
was really ill when I found no letter from her in
Berlin. She <i>did</i> promise to write, probably by now
she is married.</p>

<p>“I can picture it all again&mdash;the Neva banks, the
setting sun. In a maze of passion I pressed her
hand to my heart, and sang her the Love Song from
<i>Romeo</i>.</p>

<p>“Ah me! not two lines since I left her.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<span class="smcap">76 Harley Street, London</span>, <i>31st November
1847</i>.&mdash;Jullien asks me confidentially to get your
report on the success of Verdi’s new opera.<a name="FNanchor_23_24" id="FNanchor_23_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_24" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> We
begin next week with the <i>Bride of Lammermoor</i>,
which can hardly help going well with Madame
Gras and Reeves. He has a beautiful voice, and
sings as well as this awful English language will
allow.</p>

<p>“I had a warm reception at one of Jullien’s concerts,
but shall not begin my own until January.</p>

<p>“Your friend, M. Grimblot, has given me the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_209" id="page_209">{209}</a></span>
<i>entrée</i> to his club, but heaven only knows what
amusement is to be found in an English club.
Macready gave a magnificent dinner in my honour
last week; he is charming and most unassuming at
home, though they say he is terrible at rehearsal. I
have seen him in a new tragedy, <i>Philip van Artevelde</i>;
he is grand, and has mounted the piece splendidly.</p>

<p>“No one here understands the management and
grouping of a crowd as he does. It is masterly.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“<i>8th December.</i>&mdash;The opening of our season was
a success. Madame Gras and Reeves were recalled
frantically four or five times, and they both deserved it.</p>

<p>“Reeves is a priceless discovery for Jullien; his
voice is exquisite in quality, he is a good musician,
has an expressive face, and plays with judgment.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“<i>14th January.</i>&mdash;Jullien has landed us all in a
dreadful bog, but don’t mention it in Paris, as we
must not spoil his credit. It is not the Drury Lane
venture that has ruined him; that was done before;
now he has gone off to the provinces and is making
a lot of money with his promenade concerts, while
we take a fair amount each night at the theatre,
none of which goes into our pockets, for <i>we are not
paid at all</i>. Only the orchestra, chorus, and work-people
are paid every week in order to keep the
thing going somehow.</p>

<p>“If Jullien does not pay me on his return, I shall
arrange with Lumley to give some concerts in Her
Majesty’s Theatre, for there is a good opening here
since poor Mendelssohn’s death.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“<i>12th February 1848.</i>&mdash;My music has taken with
the English as fire to gunpowder. The <i>Rakoczy</i>
and <i>Danse des Sylphes</i> were encored. Everyone of
importance, musically, was at Drury Lane for my
concert, and most of the artists came to congratulate
me. They had expected something
diabolic, involved, incomprehensible. Now we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_210" id="page_210">{210}</a></span>
see how they agree with our Paris critics. Davison
himself wrote the <i>Times</i> critique; they cut half of it
out from want of space; still the remainder has had
its effect. Old Hogarth of the <i>Daily News</i> was truly
comical: ‘My blood is on fire,’ said he; ‘never have
I been excited like this by music.’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p></div>

<p>Jullien, coming finally to the end of his resources,
was obliged to call a council of war. It
consisted of Sir Henry Bishop, Sir George Smart,
Planché, Gye, Marezeck, and myself.</p>

<p>He talked wildly of the different operas he
proposed to mount, and finally came to <i>Iphigenia in
Tauris</i>, which, like many others, is promised yearly
by the London managers. Impatient at my silence
he turned upon me:</p>

<p>“Confound it all! surely you know that?”</p>

<p>“Certainly I know it. What do you want me
to tell you?”</p>

<p>“How many acts there are, how many characters,
what voices and, above all, the style of
setting and costume.”</p>

<p>“Take a pen and paper and I will tell you.
Four acts, three men: Orestes, baritone; Pylades,
tenor; Thoas, high bass; a grand woman’s part,
Iphigenia, soprano; a small one, Diana, mezzo-soprano.
The costumes you will not like, unfortunately;
the Scythians are ragged savages on the
shores of the Black Sea; Orestes and Pylades are
shipwrecked Greeks. Pylades alone has two dresses&mdash;in
the fourth act he comes in in a helmet&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A helmet!” cried Jullien, excitedly; “we are
saved! I’ll write to Paris for a golden helmet with
a pearl coronet, and an ostrich plume as long as my
arm. We’ll have forty performances.”</p>

<p>“Prodigious!” as good Dominie Sampson says.</p>

<p>Needless to say, nothing happened. Reeves, the
divine tenor, laughed at the bare idea of singing<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_211" id="page_211">{211}</a></span>
Pylades, and Jullien quitted London shortly after,
leaving his theatre to go to pieces.</p>

<h2><a name="XXXI" id="XXXI"></a>XXXI<br /><br />
<small>MY FATHER’S DEATH&mdash;MEYLAN</small></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Already</span> saddened on my return to Paris by the
havoc and ruin caused by the Revolution, it was but
my usual fate to suffer in addition, the terrible sorrow
of losing my father.</p>

<p>My mother had died ten years before, and, bitter
as was that blow, it was but light in comparison
with the wrench of parting with this dearly loved
and sympathetic friend.</p>

<p>We had so much in common, our tastes were
similar in so many ways, and, since he had gladly
acknowledged himself in the wrong over my choice
of a profession, we had been so entirely at one.</p>

<p>Ah! that I could have gratified his ardent wish
to hear my <i>Requiem</i>, but it was not to be.</p>

<p>I pass over the sorrow of my home-coming, the
meeting with my grief-worn sisters, the sight of his
empty chair, of his watch&mdash;still living, though he
was dead!</p>

<p>A strange wish to indulge the luxury of grief
crept over me; I must drink this wormwood cup to
the dregs; I must revisit Meylan&mdash;the early home
of my Mountain Star&mdash;and live over again my early
love and sorrow.</p>

<p>Even now my heart beats faster as I recall my
journey. Thirty-three years ago and I, a ghost,
come back to my early haunts! As I climb through
the vineyards the thoughts, the aspirations, the
desires of my childish days crowd in upon me.</p>

<p>Here did I sit with my father, playing <i>Nina</i> to
him on my flute; there did Estelle stand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_212" id="page_212">{212}</a></span></p>

<p>I turn and take in the whole picture; that blessed
house, the garden, the valley, the river, and the
far-off Alpine glaciers.</p>

<p>Once more I am young; life and love&mdash;a glorious
poem&mdash;lie before me; on my knees I cry to the
hills, the valleys, the heavens: “Estelle! Estelle!”</p>

<p>Bleed, my heart, bleed! but leave me still the
power to suffer!</p>

<p>I rise and wander on, noting each familiar point.
Here is her cherry tree; there still flowers the
plant of everlasting pea from which she plucked
blossoms. Sweet plant! bloom on in thy solitude!
Good-bye! good-bye!</p>

<p>Good-bye to my childhood, to my lost love&mdash;Time
sweeps me on; Stella! Stella!</p>

<p>The cold hand of Death lies heavy on my heart,
yet around me are soft sunlight, solitude, and
silence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next day I asked my cousin Victor:</p>

<p>“Do you know Madame F&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“The lovely Estelle D&mdash;&mdash;, do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I loved her so when I was twelve&mdash;I love
her yet.”</p>

<p>“You idiot,” said Victor, laughing, “she is fifty-one,
and has a son of twenty-two.”</p>

<p>He laughed again, and I laughed too, but mine
was the cry of despair, an April gleam through the
rain.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless I want to see her.”</p>

<p>“Hector, I beg you will do no such thing. You
will make a fool of yourself and upset her.”</p>

<p>“I want to see her,” I repeated doggedly, with
clenched teeth.</p>

<p>“Fifty-one!” he cried again, “you had much
better keep your bright, fresh, youthful memory
of her.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I will write.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_213" id="page_213">{213}</a></span>”</p>

<p>He gave me a pen, and subsided into an armchair
in fits of laughter, while my incoherent,
despairing letter was composed. I sent it, but no
reply came. When next I go to Grenoble I mean
to see her.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In May 1851 I was commissioned by Government
to judge instruments at the London Exhibition, and
wrote to Joseph d’Ortigue in June 1851&mdash;</p>

<p>“I want to tell you of the extraordinary impression
made on me by the singing of six thousand Charity
School children in St Paul’s Cathedral. It is an
annual affair, and is, beyond compare, the most
imposing, the most <i>Babylonian</i> ceremony I ever
witnessed.</p>

<p>“It was a realisation of part of my dreams, and
proof positive of the unknown power of vast
musical masses.</p>

<p>“This fact is no more understood on the Continent
than is Chinese music.</p>

<p>“By-the-bye, France is easily first in the manufacture
of musical instruments. Erard, Sax and

<p>“And when for some idea, some misunderstanding,
I feel that my love may be lessened, something
within me bursts asunder, and I cry like a child with
a broken toy.</p>

<p>“I know it is puerile, but it is true, although I
do my best to cure myself. Like a true Christian,
you have punished me by returning good for evil.</p>

<p>“Your notes are capital, and I think I shall be
able to use them, though never did I feel less in the
mood for writing.</p>

<p>“I cannot make a beginning. And I am sad&mdash;so
sad! Life is slipping away. I long to <i>work</i>,
and am obliged to <i>drudge</i> in order to live. Adieu,
adieu.”</p></div>

<p class="nind">rest or a mighty rock that I may painfully climb,
thereon to forget, in the evening sunshine, the cold
rains of the plain beneath. So slow are changes in
men and things that one would need to live two
hundred years to mark any difference.</p>

<p>Nanci, my sister, died of cancer, after six months’
frightful suffering. Adèle, worn out with the fatigue
and anxiety of nursing, nearly followed her.</p>

<p>Why had no doctor the humanity to put an end
to that awful martyrdom with a little chloroform?
They administer it to avoid the pain of an operation
that lasts, perhaps, an hour, and they refuse it
when they know cure to be impossible, to spare
months of torture, when death would be the supreme
good. Even savages are more humane.</p>

<p>But no doubt my sister would have refused the
boon had it been offered. She would have said,
“God’s will be done!” Would not God’s will
have been as well interpreted by a calm, swift death
as by these months of useless agony?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My wife, too, died&mdash;mercifully without much
suffering.</p>

<p>After four years’ death-in-life, unable to speak
or move, she passed quietly away at Montmartre
on the 3rd March 1854. Her last hours were
sweetened by Louis’ presence. He was home on
leave from Cherbourg four days before she died.</p>

<p>I had been out for two hours when one of her
nurses came to tell me all was over, and I returned
but to draw aside the shroud and kiss her pale
forehead.</p>

<p>Her portrait, painted in the days of her radiant
beauty, and which I had given her the year before,
hung above her bed, looking calmly down on the
poor shell that had once enshrined her brilliant
genius.</p>

<p>My sufferings were indescribable. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_218" id="page_218">{218}</a></span>
intensified by one feeling that has always been the
hardest for me to bear&mdash;that of pity.</p>

<p>Again and again I went over Henriette’s troubles
and their crushing weight bore me to the earth.
Her losses before our marriage, her accident, the
fiasco of her second appearance, her lost beauty and
renown, our home quarrels, her jealousy&mdash;not, in
the end, without cause&mdash;our separation, her son’s
absence, her helplessness and dreary years of retrospection,
of contemplating approaching death and
oblivion.</p>

<p>Oh, the pity of it! It turns my brain.</p>

<p>Shakespeare! Shakespeare! Thou alone couldst
have understood us both, thou alone couldst have
pitied us&mdash;poor children of Art&mdash;loving, yet wounding
each other through our love! Thou art our
God, if that other God sits aloof in sublime indifference
to our torments. Thou art our father. Help
us! Save us!</p>

<p>Alone I went about my sorrowful task.</p>

<p>The Protestant pastor lived at the other side of Paris and I went to him
that evening. As my cab passed the Odéon I thought of how, in that
theatre twenty-six years before, my poor dead wife had burst like a
meteor upon Paris and had come forward, trembling and awed at her own
success, to receive the plaudits of all that was best and brightest in
France. Ophelia! Ophelia!</p>

<p>Through that door I saw her pass to a rehearsal of <i>Othello</i>. I was
nothing to her then. She would have thought the prophet mad who pointed
out a worn, distraught, unknown youth and said:</p>

<p>“Behold your husband!”</p>

<p>Yet he it is, my poor Ophelia, he who loved and suffered with you, who
tends you on this last long journey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_219" id="page_219">{219}</a></span></p>

<p>Next day, out of love for me, came d’Ortigue, Brizeux, Léon de Wailly,
some artists brought by good Baron Taylor and other kind friends to
accompany Henriette to her last rest. Twenty-five years earlier all
intellectual Paris would have been there&mdash;now, he, who loved her and had
not the courage to go with her to the little Montmartre God’s-acre, sits
and weeps alone in her deserted garden, and her young son wanders afar
on the dreary ocean.</p>

again, and her humble grave bears only&mdash;</p>

<p>Henriette Constance Berlioz-Smithson, born at Ennis, Ireland, died at
Montmartre, 3rd March 1854.</p>

<p>The papers barely noticed her death, but Jules Janin remembered and
wrote in the <i>Débats</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“These stage divinities how soon they pass!</p>

<p>“How short a time it seems since we sat with Juliet on that balcony
above the Verona road. Juliet, so fair, so ethereal, listening
dreamily as Romeo speaks, her golden voice vibrating with the
undying poetry of Shakespeare, the whole world bound by her magic
spells!</p>

<p>“She was barely twenty, this Miss Smithson, and, without knowing
it, she was a poem, a passion, a revolution&mdash;By her absolute truth
she conquered.</p>

<p>“She it was who gave the lead to Dorval, Malibran, Victor Hugo and
Berlioz. To her Delacroix owed his conception of sweet Ophelia.</p>

<p>“Now she is dead and her dream of glory&mdash;that glory which passes so
rapidly&mdash;is over and done.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_220" id="page_220">{220}</a></span></p>

<p>“In my young days they used to sing a funeral dirge to Juliet,
wherein recurred, like an old Greek chorus, the heart-breaking
refrain, ‘Throw flowers! Throw flowers!’</p>

and writing to you in the large sitting-room next to her deserted
bedroom. I have just been to the cemetery where I laid two wreaths
upon her grave&mdash;one for you and one for myself. The servants are
still here and are arranging things for the sale; I want to realise
as much as possible for you.</p>

more rational! It would make me so happy to feel that you were sure
of yourself.</p>

<p>“I shall be able to do more for you now than has hitherto been
possible, but I shall take every precaution to prevent your
squandering money. Alexis agrees that I am right.</p>

<p>“At present I am penniless and shall be for at least six months; I
must pay the doctor and the sale will bring in but little. The King
of Saxon<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_221" id="page_221">{221}</a></span>y’s director wishes me to be in Dresden next month and I
shall have to borrow money for my journey.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“<i>23rd March.</i>&mdash;Your letter is an unexpected pleasure, dear boy.
With seventy francs a month you can easily save, if you give up
your habit of squandering money. Tell me whether you can get back
the watch you pawned at Havre. My father gave it to you. If you
cannot, I will buy you another. I have had a watch chain made for
you of your mother’s hair; keep it carefully. I also had a bracelet
made for my sister, the rest of the hair I shall keep.</p>

his exquisite reference to my <i>Romeo</i> ‘Throw flowers?’ I hope for

Montmartre house is not let and I may have to pay rent there a year

<p>What more can I say of the two great passions that influenced my
life? One was a childhood’s memory&mdash;yet not to be despised since,
with my love for Estelle, awoke my love of nature. The
other&mdash;coming in my manhood with my worship of Shakespeare&mdash;took
possession of me and overwhelmed me completely. Love of Art and the
artist intermingled, each acting upon and intensifying the other.</p>

<p>Those who cannot understand this will still less understand my
vague poetic longings at the scent of a lovely rose, the sight of a
beautiful harp. Estelle was the rose that bloomed alone, Henriette
the harp that shared my music, my joys, my sorrows and of which
alas! I snapped so many, many strings!</p></div>

<h2><a name="XXXIII" id="XXXIII"></a>XXXIII<br /><br />
<small>DEAD SEA FRUIT</small></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> end of my career is in sight, or if not the end, yet are my feet set
on the steep slope leading to the goal; worn and tired, I am consumed by
a burning fire that sometimes rages with such violence as to frighten
me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_223" id="page_223">{223}</a></span></p>

<p>I begin to know French, to write fairly a page of verse, prose or score;
I love an orchestra, and can direct it; I worship Art in every form. But
I belong to a nation that cares for none of these things. Parisians are
barbarians; not one rich man in ten has a library, no one buys
books&mdash;they hire feeble novels at a penny a volume from circulating
libraries&mdash;this is sufficient mental food for all classes. For a few
francs a month they hire from the music shops the flat and dreary
compositions with which they overflow.</p>

<p>What have I to do with Paris? That Paris&mdash;the apotheosis of
industrialism in Art&mdash;that casts a scornful eye upon me, holding me only
too honoured in fulfilling my calling of pamphleteer, for which alone,
it holds, I came into the world. I <i>know</i> what I could do with dramatic
music, but to try it would be both useless and dangerous.</p>

<p>There is no suitable theatre; I must be absolute dictator of a grand
orchestra; I must have the eager good-will of all, from prima-donna to
scene-shifter; my theatre must be a gigantic musical instrument.</p>

<p>I could play it.</p>

<p>But this will never be; it would give too much scope to the cabals of my
foes, and not only should I have to face the hatred of my critics but
also the vindictive fury caused by my original style.</p>

<p>People would naturally ask, “If he becomes popular, where will our
compositions be?”</p>

<p>I proved this at Covent Garden, where a crew of Italians nearly wrecked
<i>Benvenuto Cellini</i> by hissing from beginning to end. Costa was credited
with this cabal, since I had fallen foul of him in newspaper articles
for the liberties he took with the scores of the great masters. However,
guilty or not, he knew how to quiet my doubts by doing his best to help
me during my rehearsals.</p>

<p>Indignant at my treatment, the artists of London<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_224" id="page_224">{224}</a></span> tried, unsuccessfully,
to arrange a testimonial concert for me, and through my good friend
Beale offered me a present of two hundred guineas, the subscription list
being headed by Messrs Broadwood. Although greatly moved at the kindly
generosity of the present, I was unable to accept it. French ideas would
not permit.</p>

<p>For three years I have been worried by the vision of a grand opera to
which I want to write both words and music, as I have done in the
<i>Childhood of Christ</i>.</p>

<p>So far I have resisted temptation. May I hold out until the end!<a name="FNanchor_24_25" id="FNanchor_24_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_25" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>To me the subject is magnificent, soul-stirring, which means that the
Parisians would find it flat and wearisome.</p>

<p>Even if I could believe they might like it, where should I find a woman
with beauty, voice, dramatic talent and fiery soul to fill the chief
part? The very thought of hurling myself once more against the obstacles
raised by the crass stupidity of my opponents makes my blood boil. The
shock of our collision would be too dangerous, for I feel I could kill
them all like dogs.</p>

<p>Even from concert-giving in Paris I am excluded, for, thanks to the
machinations of my enemies in the Conservatoire, the Minister of the
Interior at the prize-giving took occasion to state that in future the
hall of the Conservatoire (the only possible one for my purpose) would
be lent to <i>no one</i>. The no one could only be me, for, with two or three
exceptions in twenty years, I was the only one who so used it.</p>

<p>Although most of the executants in this celebrated society are my
friends, they are overborne by a hostile chief and a small clique; my
compositions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_225" id="page_225">{225}</a></span> therefore, are never given. Once, six or seven years ago,
they did ask me for some excerpts from <i>Faust</i>, then tried to damn them
by sandwiching them between Beethoven’s <i>C minor Symphony</i> and
Spontini’s finale to the <i>Vestal</i>. Fortunately they were disappointed,
the Sylph scene was enthusiastically encored; but Girard, who had
conducted the whole thing clumsily and colourlessly, pretended he could
not find the place, so it was not repeated.</p>

<p>After that they avoided my works like the plague.</p>

<p>Of all the millionaires in Paris none thinks of doing anything for
music. Paganini’s example was not followed, and the great artist’s gift
to me stands alone.</p>

<p>No; a composer of classical music must be absolutely independent or must
resign himself to all the miseries from which I suffered&mdash;to incomplete
rehearsals, to inconvenient concert halls, to checks of every foreseen
and unforeseen kind, and to the rapacity of the hospital tax-gatherers,
who seize one-eighth of the <i>gross</i> receipts. Usually I am willing and
anxious to make every possible sacrifice, but sometimes occasions arise
when such sacrifices cease to be generous and become criminal.</p>

<p>Two years ago, when there was still some hope of my wife’s recovery, and
therefore expenses were greatly increased, I dreamt one night of a
symphony.</p>

<p>On waking I could still recall nearly all the first movement, an allegro
in A minor. As I moved towards my writing-table to put it down, I
suddenly thought:</p>

<p>“If I do this I shall be drawn on to compose the rest, and, since my
ideas always expand, it will end by being enormously long; it will take
me three or four months; I shall write no articles, and my income will
fail. When the symphony is written I shall, weakly, have it copied and
so incur a debt of a thousand or twelve hundred francs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_226" id="page_226">{226}</a></span></p>

<p>“Then I shall be impelled to give a concert that it may be heard; the
receipts will hardly equal half the expenditure, and I shall lose money.
I have not got it. My poor invalid will be without necessary comforts,
and my son’s expenses on board ship will not be met.”</p>

<p>With a shudder of horror I threw aside my pen, saying:</p>

<p>“To-morrow I shall have forgotten the symphony.”</p>

<p>But no! Next night that obstinate motif returned more clearly than
before&mdash;I could even see it written out. I started up in feverish
agitation, humming it over and&mdash;again my decision held me back, and I
put the temptation aside. I fell asleep and next morning my symphony was
gone for ever.</p>

<p>“Coward!” cries the young enthusiast, “brave all and write! Ruin
yourself! Dare everything! What right have you to push back into
oblivion a work of art that stretches out to you its piteous hands
crying for the light of day?”</p>

<p>Ah, youth, youth! never hast thou suffered as I suffer, else wouldst
thou understand and be silent.</p>

<p>Never was I backward, when I stood alone, to bear the brunt of my own
actions, never did I fail when my wife stood beside me, alert and
hopeful, to help me on, to face with me privation and suffering in the
cause of Art. But when she lay half dead, a doctor and three nurses in
attendance, when I knew that my musical venture <i>must</i> end in disaster,
was I cowardly to hold back? Did I not do more honour to my divine
goddess, Music, in crediting her with sweet reasonableness than in
treating her as an all-devouring Moloch, greedy for human victims?</p>

<p>If I have lately been carried away in writing my trilogy <i>The Childhood
of Christ</i>, it is that I no longer have these heavy calls upon me, and
also that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_227" id="page_227">{227}</a></span> owing to my warm and generous reception in Germany, I can
count upon the performance of my works.</p>

<p>Since writing this, M. Benazet of Baden has invited me several times to
conduct the annual festival there, and, with unequalled generosity, has
given me <i>carte blanche</i> in the engagement and payment of my performers.</p>

<p>Each year Germany receives me more cordially; I have been there four
times during the last eighteen months.</p>

<p>So interested were the blind King of Hanover and his Antigone, the
Queen, in my rehearsals that they would appear at eight o’clock in the
morning and sometimes stay till noon, as the King said:</p>

<p>“In order the better to get at the heart of my meaning and to grasp more
thoroughly my new ideas.”</p>

<p>How warmly, too, he spoke of my <i>King Lear</i>&mdash;of the storm, the prison
scene, the fateful sorrows of sweet Cordelia.</p>

<p>“I did not believe there was anything so beautiful in music,” he said,
“but you have enlightened me. And how you conduct? I cannot see you but
I feel it. I owe much to Providence,” he added, simply; “this love of
music is a compensation for all I have lost.”</p>

<p>I never saw Henriette in that part, which was her best, but from her
recital of some scenes I can imagine what it must have been.</p>

<p>On my last visit to Hanover the Queen asked me to include two pieces
from <i>Romeo</i> in my programme, and the King desired me to return next
winter to superintend a theatrical performance of the same work,
allowing me to requisition artists from Brunswick, Hamburg, and even
Dresden.</p>

<p>It was the same with the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar, who said, as I took
my leave:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_228" id="page_228">{228}</a></span></p>

<p>“M. Berlioz, shake hands with me and remember my theatre is always open
to you.”</p>

<p>M. de Lüttichau, superintendent to the King of Saxony, has offered me
the post of director when it shall be vacant.</p>

<p>Liszt strongly advises me to accept, but I cannot say. Time enough to
decide when the place is at my disposal.</p>

<p>At present in Dresden they talk of reviving <i>Benvenuto Cellini</i>, which
Liszt has already given in Weimar, and of course I should have to go and
superintend the first performances.</p>

<p>Blessed Germany, nursing mother of Art; generous England; Russia, my
saviour; good friends in France, and you&mdash;noble hearts of all nations
whom I have known&mdash;I thank and bless you all; your memory will be my
comfort to my latest hour.</p>

<p>As for you, idiots and blind! You, my Guildenstern, Rosencrantz, Iago
and Osric! You, crawling worms of all kinds! Farewell, my friends&mdash;I
scorn you; may you be forgotten ere I die!</p>

<p>“To meet as you suggest would be indeed a
pleasure, but I dare not think of it. Since Paris
offers me but Dead Sea fruit I must of necessity
earn my bread by travelling for bread&mdash;not pleasure.</p>

<p>“No matter. If we could but live another hundred
years or so we might perhaps understand the true
inwardness of men and things. Old Demiurge must
laugh in his beard at the continual triumph of his
well-worn, oft-repeated farce.</p>

<p>“But I will not speak ill of him, since he is a friend
of yours and you have become his champion. I am
an impious wretch, full of respect for the <i>Pies</i>. Forgive
the atrocious pun!</p>

<p>“<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;Winged flights of many tinted thoughts
crowd in upon me and I long to send them, were
there but time.</p>

<small>1863&mdash;GATHERING TWILIGHT</small></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Nearly</span> ten years since I finished my memoir and
during that time my life has been as full of incident
as ever.</p>

<p>But since, for nothing on earth would I go through
the labour of writing again, I must just indicate the
chief points.</p>

<p>My work is over; Othello’s occupation’s gone.
I no longer compose, conduct, write either prose or
verse. I have resigned my post of musical critic
and wish to do nothing more. I only read, think,
fight my deadly weariness of soul and suffer from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_231" id="page_231">{231}</a></span>
the incurable neuralgia that tortures me night and
day.</p>

<p>To my great surprise I have been elected a
member of the Academy and my relations with my
colleagues are, throughout, pleasant and friendly.</p>

<p>In 1855 Prince Napoleon desired me to arrange a
great concert in the Exhibition building for the day
upon which the Emperor was to distribute the
prizes.</p>

<p>I accepted on condition that I had no pecuniary
responsibility, and M. Ber, a generous and brave
impresario, came forward and treated me most
liberally.</p>

<p>These concerts (for there were several besides the
official one) brought me in eight thousand francs.</p>

<p>In a raised gallery behind the throne I had placed
twelve hundred musicians, who were barely heard.
Not that that mattered much on the day of the
ceremony, for I was stopped at the most interesting
point of the very first piece (the <i>Imperial Cantata</i>
which I had written for the occasion) because the
Prince had to make his speech and the music was
lasting too long!!</p>

<p>However the next day the paying public was
admitted and we took seventy-five thousand francs.
This time I brought the orchestra down into the
body of the hall, with fine effect.</p>

<p>I sent to Brussels for an electrician I knew, who
made me a five-wired metronome so that by the
single movement of my left hand, I could mark time
for the five deputy conductors placed at different
points of the enormous space.</p>

<p>The <i>ensemble</i> was marvellous.</p>

<p>Since then most of the theatres have adopted
electric metronomes for the guidance of chorus-masters
behind the scenes. The Opera alone refused;
but, when I undertook the supervision of <i>Alcestis</i>,
I introduced it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_232" id="page_232">{232}</a></span></p>

<p>In these Palais de l’Industrie concerts the finest
effects were obtained from broad, grand, simple and
somewhat slow movements, such as the chorus from
<i>Armida</i>, the <i>Tibi omnes</i> of my <i>Te Deum</i> and the <i>Apotheosis</i>
of my <i>Funeral Symphony</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<i>November 1858.</i>&mdash;I have nothing to tell you, I
simply want to write. I am ill, miserable (how
many <i>I’s</i> to each line!) Always <i>I</i> and <i>me</i>! One’s
friends are for <i>oneself</i>, it ought to be oneself for one’s
friends.</p>

<p>“My dejection melts away as I write; for pity’s
sake let us write oftener! These years of silence
are insupportable.</p>

<p>“Think how horribly quickly we are dying and
how much good your letters do me!</p>

<p>“Last night I dreamt of music, this morning I
recalled it all and fell into one of those supernal
ecstasies.... All the tears of my soul poured forth
as I listened to those divinely sonorous smiles that
radiate from the angels alone. Believe me, dear
friend, the being who could write such miracles of
transcendent melody would be more than mortal.</p>

<p>“So sings great Michael as, erect upon the
threshold of the empyrean, he dreamily gazes down
upon the worlds beneath.</p>

<p>“Why, oh, why! have I not such an orchestra
that I, too, could sing this archangelic song!</p>

<p>“Back to this lower earth! I am interrupted.
Vulgar, commonplace, stupid life! Oh! that I had
a hundred cannon to fire all at once!</p>

the Opera, but I cannot tell when they will produce
it as Gounod and Gervaert have to come first. But
I am determined to worry myself no more; I will
not court Fortune, I will lie in bed and await her.</p>

<p>“All the same, I could not resist a little uncourtly
frankness when the Empress asked me when she
should hear <i>The Trojans</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>I do not know, madame, I begin to think one
must live a hundred and fifty years in order to get a
hearing at the Opera.’</p>

<p>“The annoying part is that, thanks to these
delays, my work is getting a sort of advance reputation
that may injure it in the end.</p>

<p>“I am getting on with a one-act opera for Baden,
written round Shakespeare’s <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i>.
It is called <i>Beatrice and Benedict</i>; I promise there
shall not be much <i>Ado</i> in the shape of noise in it.
Benazet, the king of Baden, wants it next year.</p>

<p>“An American director has offered me an engagement
in the <i>Dis</i>united States; but his proposals
are unavailing in view of my unconquerable
antipathy to his great nation, and my love of money
is not sufficiently great to prick me on. I do not know
whether your love for American <i>utilitarian</i> manners
and customs is any more intense than my own.</p>

<p>“In any case, it would be a great mistake to go
far from Paris now; at any moment they might
want <i>The Trojans</i>.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“<i>30th June 1862.</i>&mdash;In my bereavement I can
write but little.</p>

<p>“My wife is dead&mdash;struck down in a moment by
heart disease. The frightful loneliness, after the
wrench of this sudden parting, is indescribable.
Forgive me for not saying more.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_234" id="page_234">{234}</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>“<i>January 1858.</i>&mdash;Perhaps you have heard that a
band of ruffians surrounded the Emperor’s carriage
as he went to the opera. They threw a bomb that
killed and wounded both men and horses, but, by
great good luck, did not touch the Emperor; and
the charming Empress did not lose her head for a
moment. The courage and presence of mind of
both were perfect.</p>

<p>“I have just had a long letter from M. von
Bulow, Liszt’s son-in-law, who married Mlle.
Cosima. He tells me that he performed my <i>Cellini</i>
overture with the greatest success at a Berlin
concert. He is one of the most fervent disciples
of that crazy school of the ‘Music of the Future,’
as they call it in Germany.”</p>

<p>“They stick to it, and want me to be their
leader and standard-bearer, but I write nothing,
say nothing, but just let them go their way. Good
sense will teach reasonable people the truth.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“<i>May 1858.</i>&mdash;The foreign mail leaves to-morrow,
and I must have a chat with you, dear Louis. I
long for news. Are you well? happy?</p>

<p>“Here we are rather miserable. I am somewhat
better, but my wife is nearly always in bed and in
pain.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“<i>November 1860.</i>&mdash;Dear Boy,&mdash;Here is a hundred-franc
note. Be sure to acknowledge it. I am thankful
you are better. I, too, think my disease is wearing
itself out. I am certainly better since I gave up
remedies. Ideas for my little opera throng in so
fast that I cannot find time to write; sometimes I
begin a new one before I finish the old.”</p>

<p>“You ask how I manage to crowd Shakespeare’s
five acts into one. I have taken only one subject
from the play&mdash;the part in which Beatrice and
Benedict, who detest each other, are mutually persuaded
of each other’s love, whereby they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_235" id="page_235">{235}</a></span>
inspired with true passion. The idea is really
comic.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“<i>14th February 1861.</i>&mdash;It worries me to hear of
your state of mind.</p>

<p>“I cannot imagine what dreams have made your
present life so impossible. All I can say is that I
was, at your age, far from being as well off as you are.</p>

<p>“Nay, more; I never dared to hope that, so soon
after getting your captain’s certificate, you would
find a berth.</p>

<p>“It is natural that you should wish to get on,
but sometimes the chances of one year bring more
change into a man’s life than ten years of strenuous
endeavour.</p>

<p>“How can I teach you patience? Your mania
for marriage would make me laugh were I not
saddened by seeing you striving after the heaviest
of all fetters and after the sordid vexations of
domestic life&mdash;the most hopeless and exasperating
of all lives. You are twenty-six, and have eighteen
hundred francs, with a prospect of rapid promotion.
When I married your mother I was thirty, and had
but three hundred francs in the world&mdash;lent me by
my friend Gounet&mdash;and the balance of my Prix de
Rome scholarship.</p>

<p>“Then there were your mother’s debts&mdash;nearly
fourteen thousand francs&mdash;which I paid off gradually,
and the necessity of sending money to her mother
in England, besides which I had quarrelled with my
family, who cast me off, and was trying hard to
make my first small mark in the musical world.</p>

<p>“Compare my hardships with your present discontent!
Even now, do you think it is very lively
for me to be bound to this infernal galley-oar of
journalism?</p>

<p>“I am so ill I can hardly hold my pen, yet I am
forced to write for my miserable hundred francs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_236" id="page_236">{236}</a></span>
the while my brain teems with work and plans and
designs that fall dead&mdash;thanks to my slavery.</p>

<p>“You are well and strong, while I writhe in
ceaseless, incurable pain. Marie<a name="FNanchor_25_26" id="FNanchor_25_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_26" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> thanks you for
your kind messages. She, too, is ill. Dear boy!
you have at least a father, friend, devoted brother,
who loves you more than you seem to think, but
who wishes that your character were firmer, your
mind more decided.</p>

<p>“<i>21st February 1861.</i>&mdash;Wagner is turning our
singers into goats. It seems impossible to disentangle
this <i>Tannhäuser</i>. I hear that the last general
rehearsal was awful, and only finished at one in
the morning. I suppose they will get through
somehow.</p>

<p>“Liszt is coming to prop up the charivari.</p>

<p>“I have refused to write the critique, and have
asked d’Ortigue to do it. It is best for every reason,
and besides, it will disappoint them! Never did I
have so many windmills to run a-tilt of as I have
this year. I am deluged with fools of every species,
and am choking with anger.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“<i>5th March 1861.</i>&mdash;The <i>Tannhäuser</i> scandal grows
apace. Everyone is raging. Even the Minister left
the rehearsal in a towering passion. The Emperor
is far from pleased; yet there are still a few honest
enthusiasts left&mdash;even among French people.</p>

<p>“Wagner is decidedly mad. He will die of
apoplexy, just as Jullien did last year.</p>

<p>“Liszt never came after all. I think he expected
a fiasco. They have spent a hundred and sixty
thousand francs over mounting the opera. Well,
we shall see what Friday brings forth.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“<i>21st March 1861.</i>&mdash;The second performance of
<i>Tannhäuser</i> was worse than the first. No more
laughter, the audience was too furious, and, regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_237" id="page_237">{237}</a></span>less
of the presence of the Emperor and Empress,
hissed unmercifully. Coming out, Wagner was
vituperated as a scoundrel, an idiot, an impertinent
wretch. If this goes on, one day the performance
will stop abruptly in the middle, and there will be
an end of the whole thing.</p>

<p>“The press is unanimous in damning it.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“<i>18th April 1861.</i>&mdash;Write, dear Louis, if you
can, without the cruel knife-thrusts you gave me
in your last letter.</p>

<p>“I am worse than usual to-day, and have not
strength to begin my article. I had an ovation at
the Conservatoire after the performance of <i>Faust</i>. I
dined with the Emperor a week ago, and exchanged
a few words with him. I was magnificently bored.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“<i>2nd June 1861.</i>&mdash;You are worried, and I can
do nothing for you. Alexis is trying to find you
a position in Paris, but is unsuccessful. I am as
inefficient as he is. You alone can command your
fate. They wish me to bring out <i>Alcestis</i> at the
Opera as I did <i>Orpheus</i> at the Théâtre Lyrique, and
offer me full author’s rights, but I have refused for
various reasons.</p>

<p>“They believe that, for money, artists will stultify
their consciences; I mean to prove that their belief
is false.<a name="FNanchor_26_27" id="FNanchor_26_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_27" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>“My obstinacy has offended many. Instead of
amusing themselves by spoiling Gluck’s <i>chef d’œuvre</i>,
I wish they would spend their money over mounting
<i>The Trojans</i>. But of course they won’t, since it
is the obvious thing to do! Liszt has conquered
the Emperor; he played at Court last week, and
has been given the Legion of Honour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_238" id="page_238">{238}</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah, if one only plays the piano!”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“<i>28th October 1861.</i>&mdash;Dear Louis,&mdash;Did I not
know what a terrible effect disappointment has on
even the best characters, I should really feel inclined
to let you have some home truths. You have
wounded me mortally with a deliberate calmness
that shows you were master of your language. But
I can forgive, for you are not a bad son after all.</p>

<p>“You go too far. Is it my fault that I am not
rich, that I could not let you live idly in Paris with
a wife and children? Is there a shadow of justice
in reproaching me as you do? For nearly three
months you keep silence, then comes this ironical
letter! My poor dear boy, it is not right.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about your debt to the tailor;
send me the bill and I will pay him.</p>

<p>“You ask me to beg a post for you. From
whom? You know there never was a more awkward
man than I at asking favours.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, dear son, dear friend, dear unlucky
boy&mdash;unlucky by your own fault, not by mine.”</p>

and telegram,<a name="FNanchor_27_28" id="FNanchor_27_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_28" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> but I write to ask whether you can
come to me in Baden on the 6th or 7th August, as
I know you would enjoy hearing the last rehearsals
and first performance of my opera. In my leisure
moments you would be my companion, you would
see my friends, we should be together.</p>

<p>“Could you leave your ship so near its date for
sailing?</p>

<p>“I am not sure how much money I can send you.
The expenses of that sad ceremony&mdash;the transference
from St Germain&mdash;will be great.</p>

<p>“I am rather afraid, too, of trusting you in a
gambling town, but if you will give me your word
of honour not to stake a single florin I will trust you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_239" id="page_239">{239}</a></span></p>

<p>“My mother-in-law came back yesterday just
after I had left home to find only her daughter’s
body. She is nearly frantic and is constantly watched
by a friend who came to our help. Think of the
anguish! Write soon, my dear, dear boy.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Baden</span>, <i>10th August 1862</i>.&mdash;<i>Beatrice</i> was applauded
from end to end, and I was recalled more
times than I could count. My friends were delighted,
but I was quite unmoved, for it was one of
my days of excruciating pain and nothing seemed to
matter.</p>

<p>“To-day I am better and can enjoy their congratulations.</p>

<p>“You will be pleased too, but why have you left
me so long without a letter? Why do they keep
transferring you from boat to boat? Do not write
here again as I soon go back to Paris. Now I am
called and must go and thank my radiant singers.”</p></div>

</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<span class="smcap">Paris</span>, <i>21st August 1862</i>.&mdash;I am just home from
Baden, where <i>Beatrice</i> obtained a real triumph.</p>

<p>“I always fly to you, be my news good or evil,
I am so sure of your loving interest. Would you
had been there! it would have recalled the night of
the <i>Childhood of Christ</i>.</p>

<p>“Foes and conspirators stayed in Paris, artists
and authors journeyed to Baden to be present;
Madame Charton-Demeur was perfect, both as
singer and actress.</p>

<p>“But can you believe that my neuralgia was too
bad that day for me to take interest in anything?
I took my place at the conductor’s desk, before that
cosmopolitan audience, to direct an opera of which
I had written both words and music, absolutely,
deadly impassible. Whereby I conducted better
than usual. I was much more nervous at the second
performance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_240" id="page_240">{240}</a></span></p>

<p>“Benazet, who always does things royally, spent
outrageously in every department. He has splendidly
inaugurated the new theatre and has created a
furore. They want to give <i>Beatrice</i> at the Opera
Comique, but there is no one to do the heroine
since Madame Charton-Demeur is going to America.</p>

<p>“You would laugh at the critiques. People are
finding out that I have melody; that I can be gay&mdash;in
fact, really comic; that I am not <i>noisy</i>, which
is rather obvious, since the heavy instruments are
conspicuous by their absence.</p>

<p>“How much patience I should need were I not
so completely indifferent. Dear friend, I suffer a
perfect martyrdom daily from four in the morning
till four in the afternoon. What is to become of
me? I do not tell you this to make you patient
under your own afflictions&mdash;my woes are no compensation
to you.</p>

love and are loved. Adieu! Adieu!”</p>

<p>“<i>26th August 1862.</i>&mdash;How I should love to come
to you, as Madame Ferrand wishes! But I have
much to do here owing to my wife’s death, and
Louis has resigned his commission and is stranded.
Besides, I am busy enlarging my <i>Beatrice</i>.</p>

<p>“I am trying to cut or untie all the bonds that
hold me to Art, that I may be able to say to Death,
‘When thou wilt.’</p>

<p>“I dare not complain when I think of what you bear.</p>

<p>“Are sufferings like ours the inevitable result of
our organisation? Must we be punished for having
worshipped the Beautiful throughout our lives?
Probably.</p>

<p>“We have drunk too deeply of the enchanted
cup; we have pursued our ideals too far.</p>

<p>“Still, dear friend, you have a devoted wife to
help you to bear your cross. You know nothing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_241" id="page_241">{241}</a></span>
the dread duet beating, night and day, into your
brain&mdash;the joint voices of world-weariness and
isolation!</p>

<p>“God grant you never may! It is saddening
music.</p>

<p>“Good-bye! My gathering tears would make
me write words that would grieve you yet more.
Again, good-bye!”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“<i>3rd March 1863.</i>&mdash;Your suppositions with regard
to my depression are fortunately wrong; Louis
has certainly worried me terribly, but I have forgiven
him; he has found a ship and is now in Mexico.</p>

<p>“No; my trouble was Love. A love unsought
that met me smiling, that I did not seek, that I even
fought against for awhile.</p>

<p>“But my loneliness, my unceasing yearning for
affection, conquered me; first I let myself be loved,
then I more than loved in return, and at last a
separation became inevitable&mdash;a separation absolute
as death. That is all. I am slowly recovering, but
health such as this is sad. I will say no more....</p>

<p>“I am glad my <i>Beatrice</i> pleases you. I am going
to Weimar, where it is now in rehearsal, to conduct
a few performances in April, then I shall come back
to this wilderness&mdash;Paris.</p>

<p>“Pray, dear friend, that my apathy may become
complete, for otherwise I shall have a hard time
while <i>The Trojans</i> is in rehearsal.</p>

<p>“Good-bye; when I see your dear writing on my
desk it calms me for the day. Never forget that.”</p></div>

<small>THE TROJANS</small></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">By</span> this time (1863) I had finished the dramatic
work on which I had been engaged. Four years<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_242" id="page_242">{242}</a></span>
earlier, being in Weimar with Liszt’s devoted friend,
the Princess of Sayn-Wittgenstein&mdash;a woman whose
noble heart and mind had often been my comfort in
my darkest hours&mdash;I was drawn on to speak of my
love of Virgil and of my wish to compose a grand
opera in Shakespearian style on the second and
fourth books of the <i>Æneid</i>. I added that I knew
too well the misery and worry that would be my
fate to dare to embark on such a project.</p>

<p>Said the Princess:</p>

<p>“Your passion for Shakespeare and love for the
classics would indeed produce a work both grand
and original. You must do it.”</p>

<p>As I demurred, she continued:</p>

<p>“Listen! If you draw back from fear of petty
troubles, if you are so weak as not to suffer in the
cause of Cassandra and Dido, come here no more.
I will never see you again!”</p>

<p>Once back in Paris I began the poem of <i>The
Trojans</i>. Then I started on the score, and at the
end of three years and a half it was finished. As I
polished and repolished it I read it to many of my
friends, profiting by their criticism; then I wrote to
the Emperor begging him to read it and, should he
judge it suitable, to use his influence to secure it a
hearing at the Opera.</p>

<p>However, M. de Morny dissuaded me from sending
my letter, and when finally <i>The Trojans</i> saw the
footlights the Emperor was not even present.</p>

<p>After many cruel disappointments with regard to
the opera,<a name="FNanchor_28_29" id="FNanchor_28_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_29" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> I at last succumbed to the persuasion of
M. Carvalho and allowed him to set <i>The Trojans at
Carthage</i> (the second section of the opera) at the
Théâtre Lyrique.</p>

<p>Although he received a Government subsidy of a
hundred thousand francs a year, neither his theatre,
singers, chorus, nor orchestra was equal to the task.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_243" id="page_243">{243}</a></span>
Both he and I made great sacrifices, and I, out of
my small income, paid some extra musicians and cut
up my orchestration to bring it within his limits.</p>

<p>Madame Charton-Demeur, the only possible woman
for Dido, most generously accepted fees far below
those offered her in Madrid, but despite everything
the production was incomplete; indeed, the sceneshifters
made such a muddle of the storm scene
that we were obliged to suppress it entirely.</p>

<p>As I said before, if I am to superintend a really
fine representation I must have an absolutely free
hand, and the good-will of every one around, otherwise
I get worn out with storming at opposition,
and end by resigning and letting everything go to
the devil as it will.</p>

<p>I cannot describe what Carvalho<a name="FNanchor_29_30" id="FNanchor_29_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_30" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> made me suffer
in demanding cuts that he deemed necessary. When
he dared ask no more he worked upon me through
friends, whose niggling, peddling criticism drove me
nearly mad. Said one:</p>

<p>“How about your rhapsodist with the four-stringed
lyre? I daresay you are right as to
archæology, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“It is rather dangerous; people are certain to
laugh.”</p>

<p>“H’m! laughable is it that an antique lyre should
have only four notes?”</p>

<p>Another:</p>

<p>“There is a risky word in your prologue that I
fairly tremble over.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“<i>Triomphaux.</i>”</p>

<p>“Well, why not? Is not it the plural of <i>triomphal</i>
just as <i>chevaux</i> is of <i>cheval</i>?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_244" id="page_244">{244}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it is not much used.”</p>

<p>“Oh, confound it all! If, in an epic poem, I
were to use words suited to vaudevilles and variety
shows, I should not have much choice of language.”</p>

<p>“Well, people will certainly laugh.”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! triomphaux! It is really almost as
funny as Molière’s <i>tarte à la crême</i>. Ha! ha!”</p>

<p>A third:</p>

<p>“I say! You really must <i>not</i> let Æneas come on
in a helmet.”</p>

<p>“And why not?”</p>

<p>“Why, Mangin, the gutter pencil-seller, wears
one. Certainly his is a mediæval one, but that
doesn’t matter. The gallery cads will certainly
howl ‘Hallo! there’s Mangin!’</p>

<p>“I see&mdash;a Trojan hero may not wear a helmet,
lest he should be like Mangin!”</p>

<p>Number four:</p>

<p>“Old fellow, do something to please me!”</p>

<p>“What is it now?”</p>

<p>“Suppress Mercury. Those wings on his head
and his heels are really too comical. No one ever
saw anybody with wings anywhere but on their
shoulders.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you have seen people with wings on their
shoulders? I have not, but I can quite understand
that wings in unexpected places are awkward. One
does not often meet Mercury strolling about the
streets of Paris.”</p>

<p>Can any one conceive what these crass idiots
made me endure? In addition, I had to fight the
musical ideas of Carvalho, who could not believe
that, after studying opera for forty years, I knew
just a little about it.</p>

<p>The actors alone loyally abstained from worrying
me, for which forbearance I give them all most
hearty thanks.</p>

<p>The first performance took place on the 4th<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_245" id="page_245">{245}</a></span>
November 1863. There was no hostile demonstration
except the hissing of one man, and he kept
on regularly up to the tenth night. Five papers
said everything insulting that they could think of,
but, on the other hand, fifty articles of admiring
criticism&mdash;among them those of my friends, Gasperini,
d’Ortigue, L. Kreutzer, and Damcke&mdash;filled
me with a joyous pride to which I had too long been
a stranger.</p>

<p>I also received many appreciative letters, and was
frequently stopped in the street by strangers who
begged to shake hands with the author of <i>The
Trojans</i>.</p>

<p>Were these not compensations for the diatribes
of my foes? In spite of the cutting and polishing
(I called it mutilation) that my <i>Trojans</i> suffered at
the hands of Carvalho, it only ran twenty-one nights.
The receipts did not reach his expectations; he cancelled
the engagement of Madame Charton-Demeur,
who left for Madrid, and to my great comfort my
work disappeared from the play-bills.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, being both author and composer,
my royalties for those twenty-one performances and
the sale of the piano score in Paris and London
amounted&mdash;to my unspeakable joy&mdash;to about the
annual income I derived from the <i>Journal des Débats</i>,
and I was, therefore, able to resign my post as
critic.</p>

<p>Freedom, after thirty years of slavery! No more
articles to concoct, no more platitudes to excuse, no
more commonplaces to extol, no more righteous
wrath to bottle up, no more lies, no more farces, no
more cowardly compromises! Free! I need never
more set foot in theatre! Gloria in excelsis! Thanks
to <i>The Trojans</i> the wretched quill-driver is free!!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My <i>Beatrice</i>, having been a success at Baden
in August 1862, was translated into German,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_246" id="page_246">{246}</a></span>
and, at the request of the Grand Duchess of Saxe-Weimar,
was given at Weimar in April 1863. Their
Serene Highnesses desired me to direct the two first
performances, and, as usual, overwhelmed me with
kindness.</p>

<p>So did the Prince of Hohenzollern-Hechingen,
who sent his Kapellmeister to invite me to conduct
a concert at Löwenberg, his present residence.</p>

<p>He told me that his orchestra knew all my
symphonies, and wished for a programme drawn
exclusively from my own works.</p>

<p>“Your Highness,” I said, “since your orchestra
knows all, be pleased to choose for yourself. I will
conduct whatever you wish.”</p>

<p>He therefore chose <i>King Lear</i>, the festival and
love-scene from <i>Romeo</i>, the <i>Carnaval Romain</i> overture,
and <i>Harold in Italy</i>. As he had no harpist,
Madame Pohl of Weimar, with her husband, was
invited.</p>

<p>The Prince had greatly changed since my visit in
1842; he was a martyr to gout, and was, after all,
unable to be present at the concert he had planned.
He was keenly disappointed, for, said he, “You
are not a mere conductor; you are the orchestra
itself; it is hard that I cannot reap the benefit of
your stay here.”</p>

<p>He has built a splendid music-room in the castle,
with a musical library; the orchestra is composed of
about fifty <i>musical</i> musicians, and their conductor,
M. Seifriz, is both patient and talented. They are
not worried with lesson-giving, church or theatre
work, but belong exclusively to the Prince.</p>

<p>My rooms were close to the concert hall, and the
first afternoon, at four, a servant came to say:</p>

<p>“Monsieur, the orchestra awaits you.”</p>

<p>There I found the forty-five silent artists, instruments
in hand and all in tune!!</p>

<p>They rose courteously to receive me, <i>King Lear</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_247" id="page_247">{247}</a></span>
was on the desk, I raised my baton and everything
went with spirit, smoothness, and precision, so that&mdash;not
having heard the piece for ten or twelve years&mdash;I
said to myself in amazement: “It is tremendous!
Can I really have written it?”</p>

<p>The rest was just as good, and I said to the
players:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, to rehearse with you is simply a
farce; I have not a single objection to make.”</p>

<p>The Kapellmeister played the viola solo of <i>Harold</i>
perfectly (in the other pieces he returned to his
violin), and I can truly say that never have I heard
it more perfectly done.</p>

<p>And ah! how they sang the <i>adagio</i> of <i>Romeo</i>! We
were transported to Verona, Löwenberg was gone.
At the end Seifriz rose and, after waiting a moment
to conquer his emotion, cried in French: “There is
nothing finer in music!”</p>

<p>Then the orchestra burst into storms of applause,
and I bit my lip.... Messengers passed constantly
back and forth to the poor Prince in his bed to
report progress, but nothing consoled him for his
absence. Every few minutes during dinner he would
either send for me or a big, powdered lacquey would
bring me a pencilled note on a silver salver. Sometimes
I would spend half an hour at his bedside
and listen to his praises. He knows all that I have
written, both prose and music.</p>

<p>On the day of the concert a brilliant audience
filled the hall; by their enthusiasm one could see
that my music was an old friend. After the <i>Pilgrim’s
March</i> an officer came on to the platform and pinned
on my coat the cross of Hohenzollern. The secret
had been so well guarded that I had not the slightest
idea of such an honour.</p>

<p>But it pleased me so greatly that, just for my own
satisfaction, and without thought of the public, I
played the orgie from <i>Harold</i> in my very own<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_248" id="page_248">{248}</a></span>
style&mdash;furiously&mdash;so that it made me grind my
teeth.</p>

<p>I might say much more of this charming interlude
of my life, but I must only mention the exquisite
cordiality of the Prince’s circle and particularly of the
family of Colonel Broderotti, whose perfect French
was a real relief to me, since I dislike to hear my
own language badly spoken yet know no German.
As I took leave of the Prince he embraced me,
saying:</p>

<p>“You are going to Paris, my dear Berlioz,
where many love you. Tell them I love them for
it.”</p>

<p>But I must go back to <i>Beatrice</i>.</p>

<p>To my mind it is one of the liveliest and most
original things I have ever done, although it is
difficult&mdash;especially in the men’s parts. Unlike <i>The
Trojans</i> it is inexpensive to mount; but they will
take precious care not to have it in Paris; they are
right, it is not Parisian music at all. With his usual
generosity, M. Benazet paid me four thousand francs
for the music and the same for the words&mdash;eight
thousand in all, and gave me another thousand to
conduct it the following year.</p>

<p>The Maidens’ duet became very popular in Germany
and I remember making the Grand Duke
laugh heartily about it one night at supper. He
had been catechising me on my life in Paris and my
revelations anent our musical world sadly disillusioned
him.</p>

<p>“How, when and where did you write that lovely
duet?” he asked, “surely by moonlight in some
romantic spot&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sir,” I replied, “it was one of those scenes that
artists mark and store up for future use and which
come forth when needed, no matter amid what surroundings.
I sketched it in at the Institute during
an oration of one of my colleagues.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_249" id="page_249">{249}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha!” laughed he, “that speaks well for
the orator. His eloquence must have been great.”</p>

<p>Later on it was performed at one of our Conservatoire
concerts and made an unheard-of sensation.
Even my faithful hissers dared not uplift their voices.
Mesdames Viardot and Vanderheufel-Duprez sang
it deliciously, and the marvellous orchestra was
dainty and graceful. It was one of those performances
one sometimes hears&mdash;in dreams. The Conservatoire
Society, directed by my friend, Georges
Hainl, was no longer inimical to me and proposed to
give excerpts from my scores occasionally. I have
now presented it with my whole musical library,
with the exception of the operas; it ought some day
to be fairly valuable and it could not be in better
hands.</p>

<p>I must not forget to mention the Strasburg festival,
where I conducted my <i>Childhood of Christ</i> in a vast
building seating six thousand people. I had five
hundred performers, and to my surprise, this work&mdash;written
almost throughout in a quiet, tender vein&mdash;made
a tremendous impression, the mystic, unaccompanied
chorus, “O my soul!” even causing
tears.</p>

<p>Ah! how happy am I when my audience weeps!</p>

<p>I have heard since that many of my works have
been given in America, Russia and Germany.</p>

<p>So much the better! Could I but live a hundred
and forty years my musical life would become distinctly
interesting.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had married again&mdash;<i>it was my duty</i>, and after
eight years my wife died suddenly of heart disease.
Some time after her burial in the great cemetery at
Montmartre, my dear friend, Edouard Alexandre
(the organ builder, whose goodness to me has been
unbounded), thinking her grave too humble, made
me a present of a plot of ground <i>in perpetuity</i>. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_250" id="page_250">{250}</a></span>
a vault was built and I was obliged to be present at
the re-interment. It was a heart-rending scene
and quite broke me down; I seemed to have touched
the lowest depths of misery, but this was nothing to
what followed soon after.</p>

<p>I was officially notified that the small cemetery at
Montmartre, where Henriette lay, was to be closed
and that I must remove her dear body. I gave the
necessary orders and one gloomy morning set out
alone for the deserted burial-ground. A municipal
officer awaited me and as I came up a sexton jumped
down into the open grave. The ten years buried
coffin was still intact with the exception of the cover,
decayed by damp, and the man, instead of lifting it
to the surface, pulled at the rotten boards, which
tearing asunder with a hideous noise, left the remains
exposed.</p>

<p>Stooping, he took in his hands that fleshless head,
discrowned and gaunt, the head of poor Ophelia and
placed it in the new coffin lying on the brink of the
grave&mdash;alas! alas! Again he stooped and raised the
headless trunk, a black repulsive mass in its discoloured
shroud&mdash;it fell with a dull, hopeless sound
into its place. The officer a few paces off, stood
watching. Seeing me leaning against a cypress tree
he cried:</p>

<p>“Come nearer, M. Berlioz, come nearer.”</p>

<p>And, to add a grotesque weirdness to this horrible
spectacle he added, misusing a word:</p>

<p>“Ah, poor <i>inhumanity</i>!”</p>

<p>In a few moments we followed the hearse down
the hill to the great cemetery, where the new vault
yawned before us. Henriette was laid within and
there those dear dead women await me.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am nearly sixty-one; past hope, past visions, past
high thoughts; my son is far away; I am alone;
my scorn for the dishonesty and imbecility of men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_251" id="page_251">{251}</a></span>
my hatred of their insane malignity are at their
height; and every day I say again to Death:</p>

<p>“When thou wilt!”</p>

<p>Why does he tarry?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<span class="smcap">Paris</span>, <i>August 1864</i>.&mdash;Yes, really and truly!

Sixty of us were there, including His Excellency’s

<p class="c">

</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<i>August 1864.</i>&mdash;Thank you for your cordial
letter. The officer’s cross and Vaillant’s letter
pleased me&mdash;both for my friends’ sake and my
enemies’. How <i>can</i> you keep any illusions about
music in France? Everything is dead except
stupidity.</p>

<p>“I am almost alone. Louis has gone back to St
Nazaire and all my friends are scattered except
Heller, whom I see sometimes. We dine together
at Asnières and are about as lively as owls; I read
and re-read; in the evenings I stroll past the theatres
in order to enjoy the pleasure of not going in.
Yesterday I found a comfortable seat on a tomb in
Montmartre cemetery and slept for two hours.</p>

<p>“Sometimes I go and see Madame Erard at Passy,
where I am welcomed with open arms; I relish
having no articles to write and being thoroughly
lazy.</p>

<p>“Paris gets daily more beautiful; it is a pleasure
to watch her blossoming out.</p>

<p>“I hear there is to be a mighty festival at Carlsruhe;
Liszt has gone there from Rome and they are
going to discourse ear-splitting music. It is the
pow-wow of young Germany presided over by Hans
von Bulow.”</p></div>

<p>Rarely have I suffered from <i>ennui</i> so terribly as I
did during the beginning of September 1864.</p>

<p>My friends were away except Stephen Heller, the
delicate wit and learned musician, who has written
so much lovely music for the piano and whose gentle
melancholy and devotion to the true deities of Art<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_253" id="page_253">{253}</a></span>
made him to me such a grateful companion. My
son was home from Mexico, he, too, was not lively
and we often pooled our gloom and dined together.</p>

<p>One day, after dinner at Asnières, we walked
beside the river and discussed Shakespeare and
Beethoven, my son taking part in the Shakespeare
portion, since, unfortunately, he was then unacquainted
with Beethoven. We finally agreed that
it was worth while living in order to worship the
Beautiful, and if we could not annihilate all that is
inimical to it we must be content to despise the
commonplace and recognise it as little as possible.
The sun was setting; we sat on the river-bank
opposite the isle of Neuilly, and, as we watched the
wayward wheeling of the swallows over the water,
I suddenly remembered where I was.</p>

<p>I looked at my son&mdash;I thought of his mother.</p>

<p>Once more, in spirit, I lay half asleep in the
snow as I had done in that very spot thirty-six
years before, during those frenzied wanderings
around Paris.</p>

<p>Once again I recalled Hamlet’s cold remark
over the Ophelia he loved no longer, “What! the
fair Ophelia?”</p>

<p>“Long ago,” I said to my companion, “one
winter’s day, I was nearly drowned here trying to
cross the Seine on the ice. I had walked aimlessly
since early morning&mdash;&mdash;” Louis sighed.</p>

<p>The following week he left me, and a great
yearning for Vienne, Grenoble, above all, Meylan,
came over me. I wished to see my nieces and&mdash;one
other woman, if I could get her address.</p>

<p>I left Paris. My brother-in-law, Suat, and his
two daughters met me with joy. But my joy was
chastened, for on entering their drawing-room the
portrait of my dear Adèle&mdash;now four years dead&mdash;faced
me. It was a terrible blow, and my nieces
looked on in sorrowful amazement at my grief.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_254" id="page_254">{254}</a></span></p>

<p>Daily familiarity with the room, its furniture,
the portrait, had already softened their loss to them;
to me all was fresh.</p>

<p>Dear tender-hearted Adèle! my willing slave,
my indulgent guardian. How well I remember
one day, after I came from Italy, that it rained in
torrents, and I said:</p>

<p>“Adèle, come for a walk.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, dear boy,” she said, promptly; “wait
till I get my galoshes.”</p>

<p>“Really,” said my elder sister, “you must be
quite crazy to want to paddle about the fields in
such weather.”</p>

<p>But, despite mockery and jokes, we took a big
umbrella and arm-in-arm walked about six miles
without speaking a word. We loved each other.</p>

<p>After spending a peaceful fortnight with my
brother-in-law, during which he got me Madame F.’s
address in Lyons, I could no longer resist a pilgrimage
to St Eynard, such as I had made sixteen
years before.</p>

<p>There soared the ancient rock, there stood the
small white house ... to-day, her old home;
to-morrow, perhaps, Estelle herself! Sixteen years
had passed as one night, all was unchanged. The
little shady path, the old tower, the leafy vines, the
glorious view over the valley. Till then I had kept
calm, only murmuring, “Estelle! Estelle! Estelle!”
but now, overcome with emotion, I fell prone on my
face, hearing with each heart-beat the fatal words:</p>

<p>“Past! Past! Gone for ever!”</p>

<p>I arose, and chipping from the tower a morsel
of stone that she perchance may have touched, went
on my way.</p>

<p>There is the rock whereon I laid my posy of
pink peas&mdash;but where are the flowers? Gone, or
perhaps only past their flowering stage. Here is
the cherry tree. How grown!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_255" id="page_255">{255}</a></span></p>

<p>I break off a fragment of bark and, passing my
arms around the trunk, press it passionately to my
breast.</p>

<p>Dear tree, you remember her! You understand!</p>

<p>At the avenue gate I resolved to go up to the
house; perhaps the new owners would not be too
suspicious of me. In the garden I met an old lady
who seemed startled at the sight of a stranger.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, madame,” I stammered, “might I
go through your garden&mdash;in memory of&mdash;old
friends?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, monsieur, go where you will.”</p>

<p>Further on a girl was on a ladder gathering
pears. I bowed and passed on, pushing my way
through the bushes, now so neglected, and cutting
a branch of syringa to hide next my heart. As I
came to the open door, I paused on the threshold to
look in. The maiden of the pear tree, no doubt
warned by her mother, came forward and courteously
asked me in.</p>

<p>That little room, looking over the wide valley,
that <i>she</i> had so proudly shown me when I was
twelve years old&mdash;the same furniture, the same&mdash;&mdash;I
tore my handkerchief with my teeth. The girl
watched me uneasily.</p>

<p>“Do not mind me, mademoiselle. All is so
strange&mdash;I have not&mdash;been here for forty-nine
years!”</p>

<p>And, bursting into tears, I fled.</p>

<p>What could those ladies have thought of that
strange scene, to which they never got a key?</p>

<p>Reader, do I repeat myself? In sooth it is always
so; remembrance, regret, a weary soul clutching at
the past, fighting despairingly to retain the flying
present. Always this useless struggle against time,
always this wild desire to realise the impossible,
always this frantic thirst for perfect love! How<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_256" id="page_256">{256}</a></span>
can I help repeating myself? The sea repeats itself;
are not all its waves akin?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That night I reached Lyons and spent a sleepless
night thinking of my meeting with Madame F.</p>

<p>I decided to go at noon, and to send the following
letter to prepare her for her visitor:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<span class="smcap">Madame</span>,&mdash;I have just come from Meylan, from
my second pilgrimage to the hallowed haunts of my
childhood’s dreams. It has been even more painful
than that of sixteen years ago, after which I wrote
to you at Vif. This time I ask for more; I dare to
beg you to see me. I can control myself; you need
fear no transports from a heart out-worn and crushed
by the pressure of cruel Fate. Give me but a few
moments! Let me see you, I implore.</p>

<p>
“<i>23rd September 1864.</i>        <span class="smcap">Hector Berlioz.</span>”<br />
</p></div>

<p>I could not wait till noon. At half-past eleven I rang; gave her maid my
card and the letter. She was at home. I ought only to have sent up the
letter, but I was past knowing what I was doing. Without hesitation she
came to meet me. I at once recognised her graceful yet stately air&mdash;the
step of a goddess. But, ah! how changed her face! Her complexion
darkened, her hair silvered.</p>

<p>Yet my heart went out to my idol as though she had been in all the
freshness of her youthful beauty.</p>

<p>Holding my note, she led the way to her drawing-room. My emotions choked
me, I was dumb; with gentle dignity she began:</p>

<p>“We are old acquaintances, M. Berlioz&mdash;&mdash;” Silence.</p>

<p>“We were but children then&mdash;&mdash;” Still silence.</p>

<p>Feeble as the cry of a drowning man came my halting voice:</p>

<p>She opened and read it, then laid it on the chimney-piece.</p>

<p>“Then you have been in Meylan; by chance, no doubt?”</p>

<p>“Oh, madame, can you believe it needed chance to take me there? For how
long had I not yearned to see it once more?”</p>

<p>Again silence.</p>

<p>“Your life has been a stirring one, M. Berlioz.”</p>

<p>“How do you know, madame?”</p>

<p>“I have read your biography&mdash;by Méry, I think. I bought it some years
ago.”</p>

<p>“Pray, do not think that my friend Méry, an artist and a clever man, is
guilty of such a tissue of fables and nonsense as that! I believe I can
guess the real author. But I shall soon have a true biography ready, one
I have written myself.”</p>

<p>“And you write so well!”</p>

<p>“Nay, madame, I do not mean to praise the style, but simply to say that
at least it will be true. In it, without naming you, I have been able to
tell all my feeling for you without restraint.”</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>“I have also heard of you,” went on Madame F., “from a friend of yours
who married my husband’s niece.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is he whom I asked to tell me the fate of a letter I wrote you
sixteen years ago. I longed to know whether you received it. I never saw
him again, and now he is dead.”</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>“My life has been very quiet, very sad. I lost some of my children, and
my husband died while the others were very young. I did my best alone to
bring them up well.”</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>“I am indeed grateful, M. Berlioz, for the kind thoughts you have kept
of me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_258" id="page_258">{258}</a></span>”</p>

<p>At her gentle words my heart beat yet more violently.</p>

<p>With hungry eyes I gazed and gazed, clothing her once more in the beauty
of long past days. At length I said:</p>

<p>“Madame, give me your hand.”</p>

<p>Pressing it to my lips, my heart turned to water within me, the world
sank away, a long and blessed silence brooded over us.</p>

<p>“Dare I hope,” I murmured, “that I may write to you? That, at long
distant intervals, I may even see you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly; but I am leaving Lyons soon to live with my son who,
after his marriage, is to settle in Geneva.”</p>

<p>I rose, not daring to stay longer. She came with me to the door, saying,
“Good-bye, M. Berlioz, good-bye. I am more grateful than I can tell you
for your long and sweet memory of me.”</p>

<p>Once more I bent over her hand, pressing it to my burning forehead, then
tore myself away but only to wander, aimlessly and feverishly, near her
dwelling.</p>

<p>As I watched the swirling Rhone rush under the Pont Morand, M.
Strakosch, brother-in-law of Adelina Patti, came up to me.</p>

<p>“You!” he cried, “Good-luck! Adelina will be so glad to see you. She is
singing to-morrow in the <i>Barbiere</i>; will you have a box?”</p>

<p>“Many thanks, I may be leaving this evening.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyway come to dinner with us to-day. You know how much pleasure
it gives us.”</p>

<p>“I dare not promise&mdash;It depends&mdash;I am not very well&mdash;Where are you
staying?”</p>

<p>“Grand Hotel.”</p>

<p>“So am I. Well, if I am not too unsociable this evening I will come. But
don’t wait.”</p>

<p>I suddenly thought of an excuse to see Madame F. once more. If she would
go to the theatre I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_259" id="page_259">{259}</a></span> would stay also, if she would allow me the honour
of escorting her. If she would not I would leave at once.</p>

<p>I hurried round to her house. She was out but I left a message with her
maid and then went off to pass a day of torturing uncertainty. Hour
after hour went by and no answer came, time after time I returned to
find the house shut up and to get no answer to my ring.</p>

<p>Could it be that she had told her people not to admit me?</p>

<p>What would become of me! Where should I go! What do! There seemed no
refuge for me but the Rhone!</p>

<p>Finally in one last despairing attempt I heard ladies’ voices above me
on the stairs and saw her coming down, a note in her hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, M. Berlioz, I am so sorry I have only just got your message and
here is my answer. Unfortunately I shall be away from home to-morrow; a
thousand pardons for the inconvenience I have caused you.”</p>

<p>She was putting the letter in her pocket when I cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, please let me have it!”</p>

<p>“It is hardly worth while&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I beg of you, since it was meant for me.”</p>

<p>She gave it me and for the first time I saw her writing.</p>

<p>“Then I shall see you no more?”</p>

<p>“Not if you leave to-night. May your journey be pleasant.”</p>

<p>Pressing my hand, she and her two friends passed on, leaving me&mdash;can it
be believed?&mdash;almost happy.</p>

<p>I had seen, had spoken to her again, I had a letter from her in which
she sent me her <i>kindest regards</i>.</p>

<p>With my unhoped-for treasure I went back to the hotel to dine with
Mademoiselle Patti.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_260" id="page_260">{260}</a></span></p>

<p>As I entered her <i>salon</i> the charming diva clapped her hands joyously
and danced up to me, holding up her lovely forehead for my accustomed
kiss.</p>

<p>During dinner she spoilt me with her dainty coaxing attentions.</p>

<p>“There is something wrong with you,” she said, “what are you thinking
of? I can’t have you miserable.”</p>

<p>They came with me to the station, she, with a friend and Strakosch, and
they were allowed to go on to the platform. Adelina, dear child, clung
to me until the signal was given, then the winsome creature flung both
arms round my neck and kissed me, crying gaily:</p>

<p>“Good-bye, good-bye just for a week. We shall be in Paris on Tuesday and
you must come and see us on Thursday.”</p>

<p>Why could I not claim such affection from Madame F. and mere politeness
from Mademoiselle Patti?</p>

<p>Adelina was like a brilliant, diamond-eyed humming-bird fluttering round
me; I was enchanted but not touched. Though I liked her greatly, I did
not <i>love</i> her.</p>

<p>My soul was given to that old, sad, unsought after woman, hers it has
always been and will be to my dying day.</p>

<p>Balzac and even Shakespeare&mdash;master painters of passions&mdash;knew nothing
of love like this. Tom Moore alone has imagined and voiced it in&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Believe me if all those endearing young charms.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>How often, through that long night journey, did I repeat:</p>

<p>“Idiot! why did you leave? You might have seen her again to-morrow.”
True, but the fear of being troublesome restrained me and what could I
have done in Lyons during the hours we were apart? it would have been
but torture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_261" id="page_261">{261}</a></span></p>

<p>After a few miserable days of indecision in Paris I wrote the following
letter, which shows my deplorable state and her beautiful calm.</p>

<p>How much worse off am I now that I cannot even write to her! To enjoy
that romantic friendship to the end would have been too great a
blessing. Wounded, torn, alone, unsatisfied must I totter to my grave!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<span class="smcap">Paris</span>, <i>27th September 1864</i>.&mdash;Madame! A thousand blessings on you
for your gentle reception of me! Few women could have done as much;
yet since our meeting, I suffer most cruelly. It is useless to
repeat to myself that you could not have done more than you have;
my wounded heart bleeds on unstaunched. I ask, why? why? and my
only answer is: because I saw you so little; because I said but a
tithe of all I wished; because we parted as if for ever.</p>

<p>“Yet I held your hand, I pressed it to my lips&mdash;to my forehead and
kept back my tears as I had promised.</p>

<p>“And now the inexorable thirst for another word from you has
conquered me; in pity grant it!</p>

<p>“Think! for forty-five years I have loved you; you are my
childhood’s dream that has weathered all the storms of my most
stormy life. It <i>must</i> be true&mdash;this love of a life-time&mdash;could it,
else, master me as it still does?</p>

<p>“Do not take me for an eccentric, a plaything of my own
imagination; I am but a man of intense sensibility, of eternal
constancy and of overwhelmingly strong affections. I loved you, I
love you still, I shall always love you, although I am sixty-one
and for me the world has no more illusions.</p>

<p>“Grant me, I pray you, not as a nurse, from a sense of duty to her
sick patient, but as a noble woman stooping to heal wounds she has
unwittingly given<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_262" id="page_262">{262}</a></span>&mdash;grant me those three things that, alone, can
give me peace: permission to write sometimes, your undertaking to
reply and a promise that once a year, at least, you will allow me
to visit you.</p>

<p>“If I called without your permission I might arrive at the wrong
time, therefore I shall not venture near you unless you say:
‘Come.’</p>

<p>“Surely there is nothing strange or wrong in this? Could there be a
purer or more beautiful bond? Who shall say us nay? Still, I must
own that it would be painful to meet you only amongst others,
therefore if you bid me come it will be that we may talk as we did
last Friday when, so deeply was I moved, that I could not savour
the sweet sad charm by reason of my terror lest emotion should get
beyond control. Oh, madame! madame! I have but one end in life&mdash;to
gain your affection!</p>

<p>“Give me but leave to try! I will be so humble, so restrained; my
letters shall be as infrequent as you wish lest they become a
burden to you; five lines only from you will suffice me. My visits
will be but rare; yet, if our thoughts may meet, I shall feel
that&mdash;after these long and dreary years during which I have been
nothing to you&mdash;I may in time become your friend. Friends with such
devotion as mine are not too often found. I will encircle you with
love so sweet, so tender, with affection so compounded of all that
is simplest in a child and all that is best and grandest in a man
that, surely, in time you will feel its charm and turn to me one
day, saying:</p>

<p>“I am in very deed your friend.”</p>

<p>“Adieu, madame, once more I read your note of the 23rd with its
assurance of your <i>sentiments affectueux</i>. Surely this is no mere
formality? Tell me truly&mdash;truly!&mdash;Yours to eternity,</p>

<p class="r">

<p>“<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;I send you three books; perhaps you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_263" id="page_263">{263}</a></span> glance at them
in your leisure moments. Do you see the author’s device to make you

<p>“<span class="smcap">Monsieur</span>,&mdash;I should wrong both you and myself did I not reply at
once to your dream of our future friendship; believe me, I speak
from my heart.</p>

<p>“I am an old woman (remember I am six years your senior), worn and
withered by bodily pain and mental anguish, with all my earthly
illusions swept away.</p>

<p>“Since the fatal day, twenty years ago, that I lost my best friend,
I have said good-bye to worldly pleasures, and have found my sole
consolation in a few old friends and in my children.</p>

<p>“In this absolute calm, alone, can I find rest, and to upset it
would be burdensome indeed.</p>

<p>“In your letter of the 27th you say you have but one wish&mdash;that I
may become your friend. Do you believe, monsieur, that this could
possibly be? I hardly know you, I have seen you but once in
forty-nine years; how can I understand your tastes, your character,
your capacities&mdash;all those hundred and one points upon which,
alone, friendship can be based?</p>

<p>“With two people of like affinities, sympathy may be born and grow
into friendship, but, far apart as we are, no correspondence could
bring about what you desire.</p>

<p>“Besides, I must confess that I am most lazy about letters; my mind
is as torpid as my fingers. I could not, therefore, promise to
write regularly, for the promise would certainly not be kept.
Still, if you feel a certain pleasure in writing, I will read your
letters, although you must not expect speedy replies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_264" id="page_264">{264}</a></span></p>

<p>“Neither can I promise to receive you alone. At Geneva, in the
house of my son and his wife, it would be impossible for me to
arrange matters as you wish.</p>

<p>“I tell you all this with perfect frankness, for I feel so strongly
that, as grey hairs come, dreams must be thrust aside&mdash;such
friendships belong to the happy days of youth, not to the
disenchantments of old age.</p>

<p>“My future is so short; why indulge in a dream that must fade so
quickly? Why create these vain regrets?</p>

<p>“In what I say, monsieur, do not think that I wish to wound you, to
belittle your remembrance of the past. I respect it, and am greatly
touched.</p>

<p>“You are still young at heart, and I am old and good for nothing
but to keep a warm place for you in my memory. In your triumphs I
shall always take a cordial interest.</p>

<p>“Again, monsieur, I send you my affectionate regards.</p>

the terrible depression caused by your letter&mdash;a masterpiece of sad
truth.</p>

<p>“You are right to avoid all that might disturb your calm; but be
assured that I should never have done so, and that this friendship,
for which I so humbly begged, should never have become
<i>burdensome</i>. (Is not this rather a cruel word?)</p>

<p>“But you will take an interest in my career, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_265" id="page_265">{265}</a></span> for that I kiss
your hand with deepest gratitude. Yet, with tears, with
importunity, I pray for news of you sometimes.</p>

pray I may die first that I may send you my last farewell! But if I
must hear that you have left this sad earth ... will your son tell
it me?&mdash;pardon!</p>

<span class="smcap">Hector Berlioz</span>.”<br />
</p></div>

<p>After an impatient fortnight, I received the announcement of M. Charles
F.’s marriage, addressed in his mother’s writing; which filled me with a
joy that few can understand. I was in the seventh heaven, and wrote at
once:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<i>28th October 1864.</i>&mdash;Life is beautiful under certain aspects. I
have received the notice addressed by you! A thought for the poor
exile. May your good angel render fourfold the good you have done!
Yes, life is beautiful, but how much more beautiful death. To be at
your feet, my head upon your knee, your two hands clasped in mine,
and so to end&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Hector Berlioz</span>.”<br />
</p></div>

<p>Days passed into weeks; Madame F. had gone to Geneva. Could she intend
to withhold her address? To break her word?</p>

<p>During that anxious time I believed I should write to her no more, and
my heart despaired.</p>

<p>But one morning, as I sat drearily musing beside the fire, a card was
brought to me:&mdash;</p>

<p class="c">
“<span class="smcap">M. et Mme Charles F&mdash;&mdash;.</span>”<br />
</p>

<p>The son and his wife, and <i>she</i> had sent them!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_267" id="page_267">{267}</a></span></p>

<p>Yet how greatly it upset me to find the young man the living image of
his mother at eighteen.</p>

<p>The bride seemed quite bewildered at my emotion, although her husband
was not; evidently he knew all; Madame F. had shown my letters.</p>

<p>“How beautiful she must have been!” cried the young wife.</p>

<p>“Oh!&mdash;--”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said M. F., “I remember even now how dazzled I was, at five years
old, on seeing my mother dressed for a ball.”</p>

<p>Gradually I subdued my feelings, and was able to talk sensibly to my
visitors. Madame C. F. was a Dutch creole of Java, and knew Rajah Brooke
of Sarawak.</p>

<p>How much I should have had to ask her had I been in my usual state of
mind.</p>

<p>I saw them pleasantly often during their stay in Paris, and we talked of
<i>her</i>. As we grew more friendly, the bride scolded me for writing as I
had done.</p>

<p>“You frighten her,” she said. “Remember she hardly knows you. You must
learn to be calm, then your visits to Geneva will be delightful, and we
shall be so happy to see you. You will come, will you not?”</p>

<p>“Can you doubt it, if Madame F. gives me permission?”</p>

<p>Schooling myself rigidly, I gave them no letter for their mother when
they left; but, as my <i>Trojans</i> was to be given, I sent her a copy of
the poem, begging her to read the page I had marked with some dead
leaves at half-past two on the 18th December, the time at which that
passage would be played in Paris. Madame C. F. was to be back in Paris
then, and hoped to be present at this concert, which was making some
stir in the musical world.</p>

<p>A fortnight went by and she did not come, neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_268" id="page_268">{268}</a></span> did I have a letter.
I was almost at the end of my patience, although I would not write,
when, on the 17th, Madame C. F. returned bringing me the following
letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
“<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>16th December 1864</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Monsieur</span>,&mdash;I ought to have thanked you sooner for your charming
welcome of my son and his wife had I not been unwell, and
consequently, very idle.</p>

<p>“But I cannot let my daughter-in-law go without my grateful thanks
for all the pleasure you have given them.</p>

<p>“Suzanne will tell you all about our life here; I should be as
happy as in Lyons, were it not for my separation from my other two
sons and from my dear old friends.</p>

<p>“Once more, thank you for the libretto of <i>The Trojans</i>, and also
for the sweet souvenir of the Meylan leaves&mdash;they bring back the
bright, happy days of my youth.</p>

<p>“My son and I will read the part of your work that you have marked,
and shall think of Suzanne listening to your music on Sunday.”</p></div>

<p>To which I replied:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<span class="smcap">Paris</span>, <i>19th December 1864</i>.&mdash;Last September, when at Grenoble, I
visited one of my cousins, who lives near St Georges, a wretched
hamlet niched into the most barren mountains on the left bank of
the Drac, inhabited only by a few miserable peasants.</p>

<p>“My cousin’s sister-in-law is the sweet providence of this forsaken
corner, and on the day of my arrival she heard that one far-away
family had had no bread for three weeks.</p>

<p>“She started off at once to see the mother.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Why, Jeanne!’ she cried, ‘how could you be in trouble and not
tell me? You know how anxious we are to help.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_269" id="page_269">{269}</a></span>’</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Oh, mademoiselle, we are not really in want yet; we still have
some potatoes and a few cabbages, only the children don’t like
them. They shout and cry for bread. You know children are so
unreasonable.’</p>

<p>“Well, dear lady, you too have done a kind thing in writing. I
would not write for fear of boring you, so waited for your
daughter’s return. She came not! My anxiety choked me. You see,
madame, creatures such as I are <i>unreasonable</i>.</p>

<p>“Yet surely I&mdash;if anyone&mdash;hardly need to learn lessons that have
been taught me already by so many knife-thrusts in my heart.</p>

<p>“It seems to me that you are sad, and that makes me the more....
From to-day I mean to restrain my language, to talk of outward
things only.</p>

<p>“You know what is in my heart&mdash;all that I do not say.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you already know that, thanks to the thousand and one
annoyances brought upon me by the Conservatoire committee, my
<i>Trojans</i> was not performed yesterday. Still, I thank you for the
time you have spent in thought with us in the concert-room. My son,
who has done well in Mexico, has just landed at St Nazaire. He is
first lieutenant of his ship, and, as he cannot come to Paris, I am
going to Brittany to see him. He is a good boy, but is,
unfortunately, too much like his father, and cannot reconcile
himself to the commonplaces and troubles of this world.</p>

<p>“We love each other dearly.</p>

<p>“My aged mother-in-law, whom I have promised never to leave, takes
the greatest care of me, and accepts unquestioningly my gloomy
tempers. I read again and again Shakespeare, Virgil, Homer, <i>Paul
and Virginia</i>, and travels of all kinds. I am horribly bored and
suffer agonies from neuralgia that doctors have tried in vain, for
nine years, to cure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_270" id="page_270">{270}</a></span></p>

<p>“When the pains of mind, body and estate grow too much for me, I
take three drops of laudanum to snatch some sleep.</p>

<p>“If I feel better I go and see my friends, M. and Mme Damcke.</p>

<p>“He is a German composer of rare gifts; his wife is an angel of
goodness to me.</p>

<p>“There I do as I like. If I am in the humour we talk or play; if
not, they draw up a big sofa to the fire, and there I lie the whole
evening without a word&mdash;chewing the cud of sweet and bitter
fancies. This, madame, is all.</p>

<p>“You know that I neither write nor compose, for the present state
of art in Paris makes me both sick and sorry&mdash;which proves that I
am not dead yet!</p>

<p>“I hope to have the honour of escorting Madame C. F. and a Russian
friend of hers to the Théâtre Italien to hear Donizetti’s
<i>Poliuto</i>.</p>

<p>“Madame Charton will give me a box.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, madame. May your thoughts be blest, your heart at rest,
and your life serene in the assured love of your children and
friends. But send a thought sometimes to the <i>poor child who is
unreasonable</i>.&mdash;Your devoted</p>

<p class="r">
H. B.”<br />
</p>

<p>“<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;It was good of you to send the bride and bridegroom to see
me. I was so struck with the likeness of M. Charles to Mademoiselle
Estelle that, although such compliments are out of place to a man,
I so far forgot myself as to tell him so.”</p></div>

<p>Some time later she wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Believe me, I am not without sympathy for <i>unreasonable children</i>.
I have always found the best way to quiet them is to give them
pictures to look at.</p>

<p>“I therefore take the liberty of sending you one that I hope, by
bringing home the reality of the present, will wipe out the
illusion of the past.”</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_271" id="page_271">{271}</a></span></p>

<p>She sent me her portrait! My dear lady!</p>

<p>And here I stop.</p>

<p>Now I can live calmly. I shall write, she will reply. I shall see her,
shall know where she is, and shall never again be without news of her.</p>

<p>Perhaps, in spite of her dread of new ties, her affection for me may
grow slowly and quietly. Already life seems more possible, since the
past is not irretrievably over and done with.</p>

<p>No longer is my heaven overcast. My sweet bright star smiles upon me
from afar. She does not love me, truly, but why should she? She knows,
however, that I love her.</p>

<p>I must find consolation in the thought that she knew me too late, just
as I comfort myself for not having known Virgil, Gluck, Beethoven or
Shakespeare&mdash;who might, perhaps, have loved me too.</p>

<p>(All the same, I am not comforted in the very least!)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Which power raises man the higher? Love or Music? It is a great
question. It seems to me that one might say this: “Love cannot give an
idea of music, but music can give an idea of love&mdash;why separate them?”</p>

<p>They are the twin wings of the soul.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seeing the conception some people have of Love, and what they look for
in Art, makes me liken them to swine rooting in a bed of lovely flowers
and among mighty oaks, hoping to turn up with their snouts the truffles
for which they are greedy.</p>

<p>I will think no more of Art.... Stella! Stella! I can die now without
bitterness or anger.</p>

</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<span class="smcap">Paris</span>, <i>28th October 1864</i>.&mdash;Dear Humbert,&mdash;On
returning from my visit to Dauphiny I found
your sad letter. You must have had difficulty in
writing, yet your young friend, M. Bernard, tells me
you are able to go out sometimes, leaning on a
friendly arm.</p>

<p>“When first I went into the country my neuralgia
was better, but very soon it came back worse than
ever, from eight in the morning till four in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>“Then, oh! my weariness and troubles of all
sorts!</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, there are compensations. Louis
is doing well, though our long partings are hard
to bear, for we love each other dearly.</p>

<p>“As for the musical world, the corruption in
Paris is beyond belief, and I retire more and more
into my shell.</p>

<p>“<i>Beatrice</i> is to be performed in Stuttgart, and I
may go to conduct it. I am also asked to go to St
Petersburg in March, but shall not do so unless
they offer me a sum tempting enough to make me
brave that horrible climate. Then I shall do it
for Louis’ sake, for of what use are a few thousand
francs more to me?</p>

<p>“I cannot imagine why some people have taken
to flattering me so grossly. Their compliments are<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_273" id="page_273">{273}</a></span>
enough to scrape the paint off the walls, and I long
to say to them:</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Monsieur, you forget that I am no longer a
critic. I write no more for the papers.’</p>

<p>“The monotony of my life has been broken lately.</p>

<p>“Madame Erard, Madame Spontini and their
niece begged me to read <i>Othello</i> to them. The
door was rigorously closed to all comers, and I
read the masterpiece through from beginning to
end to my audience of six, who wept gloriously.</p>

<p>“Great heaven! What a revelation of the
deepest depths of the human heart! That angel
Desdemona, that noble fate-haunted Othello, that
devil incarnate Iago! And to think that it was
all written by a being like unto ourselves!</p>

<p>“It needs long, close study to put oneself in the
point of view of the author, to follow the magnificent
sweep of his mighty wings. And translators
are such donkeys.</p>

<p>“Laroche is the best&mdash;most exact, least ignorant&mdash;yet
I have to correct ever so many mistakes in
my copy.</p>

<p>“Liszt has been here for a week, and we dined
together twice.</p>

<p>“As we kept carefully off things musical we had
a pleasant time. He has gone back to Rome to
play the <i>Music of the Future</i> to the Pope, who asks
himself what on earth it all means.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“<i>10th November 1864.</i>&mdash;Can you believe, dear
Humbert, that I have a grudge against the past?
Why did I not know Virgil.</p>

<p>“I see him dreaming in his Sicilian villa&mdash;so
hospitable, so gracious.</p>

<p>“And Shakespeare, that mighty Sphinx, impassible
as a mirror, reflecting not creating. Yet what
ineffable compassion must he not have had for poor,
small, human things?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_274" id="page_274">{274}</a></span></p>

<p>“And Beethoven, rough and scornful, yet blessed
with such exquisite tenderness and delicacy that I
think I could have forgiven him all his contempt, his
rudeness, everything!</p>

<p>“And Gluck, the stately!...</p>

<p>“Last week M. Blanche, the doctor of the Passy
lunatic asylum, invited a party of artists and <i>savants</i>
to celebrate the anniversary of the performance of
<i>The Trojans</i>.</p>

<p>“I was invited and kept entirely in the dark.</p>

<p>“Gounod was there. In his sweet, weak voice,
but with the most perfect expression, he sang ‘<i>O
nuit d’ivresse</i>’ with Madame Bauderali; then, alone,
the song of Hylos.</p>

<p>“A young lady played the dances, and they made
me recite without music Dido’s scena, ‘<i>Va, ma
sœur</i>.’</p>

<p>“It had a fine effect. They all knew my score
by heart. I longed to have you there.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Paris</span>, <i>23rd December 1864</i>.&mdash;I have just sent
you a copy of <i>La Nation</i>, with two columns by
Gasperini about <i>The Trojans</i> business at the Conservatoire.
I did not know of that letter of Gluck.
Where the devil did you get it? That is always
the way. Beethoven was even more insulted than
Gluck. Weber and Spontini share the honour.</p>

<p>“Only people like M. de Flotow, author of
<i>Martha</i>, have panegyrists. His dull opera is sung
in all languages, all theatres.</p>

<p>“I went to hear that delicious little Patti sing
<i>Martha</i> the other day; when I came out I felt
creepy all over, just as if I had come out of a fowlhouse&mdash;with
consequences!</p>

<p>“I told the little prodigy of a girl that I would
<i>forgive</i> her for making me listen to platitudes&mdash;that
was the utmost I could do!</p>

<p>“But that exquisite Irish air, ‘The Last Rose of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_275" id="page_275">{275}</a></span>
Summer,’ is introduced, and she sings it with such
poetic simplicity that its perfume is almost enough
to disinfect the rest of the score.</p>

<p>“I will send Louis your congratulations; he will
be very pleased. He has read your letters and
thinks me fortunate in having such a friend as you.
Good-bye.”</p></div>

and I ought to reply in a sleek, smooth style, mouth
nicely buttoned up, cravat well tied, myself all
smiles and amiability. Well, I can’t!</p>

<p>“I am ill, miserable, disgusted, bored, idiotic,
wearisome, cross, and altogether impossible. It is
one of those days when I am in the sort of temper
that I wish the earth were a charged bomb, that I
might light the fuse for fun.</p>

<p>“The account of your Nice pleasures does not
amuse me in the least.</p>

<p>“I should love to see you and your dear invalid,
but I could not accept your offer of a room. I
would rather live in the cave under the Ponchettes.</p>

<p>“There I could growl comfortably alongside
Caliban (I know he lives there, I saw him one day),
and the sea does not often come into it; whereas
with friends, there are all sorts of unbearable
attentions.</p>

<p>“They ask how you pass the night, but not how
your <i>ennui</i> is getting on;<a name="FNanchor_31_32" id="FNanchor_31_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_32" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> they laugh when you say
silly things; are always mutely trying to find out
whether you are sad or gay; they talk to you when
you are only soliloquising, and then the husband
says to the wife, ‘Do let him alone, don’t bother
him,’ etc., etc. Then you feel a brute and go out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_276" id="page_276">{276}</a></span>
banging the door and feeling you have laid the train
of a domestic quarrel.</p>

<p>“Now in Caliban’s grotto there is none of this.</p>

<p>“Well, never mind!</p>

<p>“You stroll on the terrace and along the shady
walks? And then?</p>

<p>“You admire the sunsets? And then?</p>

<p>“You watch the tunny fishers? And then?</p>

<p>“You envy young English heiresses? And
then?</p>

<p>“You envy still more the idiots without ideas or
feelings who understand nothing and love nothing?
And then?...</p>

<p>“Why, bless you, I can give you all that!</p>

<p>“We have terraces and trees in Paris. There are
sunsets, English heiresses, idiots (they are even more
plentiful than at Nice for the population is larger),
and gudgeon to be caught with a line. One can be
quite as extensively bored as at Nice. It is the
same thing everywhere.</p>

<p>“Yesterday I had a delightful letter from some
unknown man about <i>The Trojans</i>. He tells me that
the Parisians are used to more <i>indulgent</i> music than
mine.</p>

<p>“Is not that an admirable epithet?</p>

<p>“The Viennese telegraph that they celebrated my
birthday by giving <i>Faust</i>, and that the double chorus
was an immense success. I did not even know I
had a birthday!”</p></div>

up, for I took laudanum yesterday and am quite stupefied. What a

I mean to go out to-night to hear Beethove<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_277" id="page_277">{277}</a></span>n’s Septuor; I want it
to warm my blood, and my favourite artists are playing it.</p>

<p>“The day after to-morrow I ought to read <i>Hamlet</i> at Massart’s.
Shall I have strength to go through it? It lasts five hours. Of my
audience of five only Madame Massart knows anything of the play.</p>

<p>“I feel almost afraid of bringing these artist natures too abruptly
face to face with this supreme manifestation of genius. It seems to
me like giving sight suddenly to one born blind.</p>

<p>“Joachim, the celebrated German violinist, has been here ten days;
he plays nearly every evening at different houses. Thus I heard

I was too ill. And now I want to tell you that I am
leaving for Monaco at seven this evening.</p>

<p>“I cannot imagine why I do not die.</p>

<p>“But since I am living, I am going to see my
dear Nice, the rocks of Villefranche and the sun of
Monaco.</p>

<p>“I hear that the sculptor is having three copies
of my New York bust cast; was it you who suggested
getting one for the St Petersburg Conservatoire?
More can easily be made.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_296" id="page_296">{296}</a></span></p>

<p>“Address your letters to me to 4 Rue de Calais,
Paris, and they will be forwarded.</p>

<p>“Oh! to think that I shall soon be lying on the
marble seats of Monaco, in the sun, by the sea!!</p>

<p>“Do not be too severely just to me. Write me
long letters in return for my short ones; bethink you
that I am ill, that your letters do me good; don’t
talk nonsense and don’t speak of my composing....</p>

<p>“My kindest regards to your charming sister-in-law
and daughter and to your brother. I can see
them all so vividly before me. Write soon. Your
letter and the <span class="smcap">Sun</span> will give me new life.</p>

the snow!”</p></div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Stassoff</span>,&mdash;You call me <i>Monsieur</i> Berlioz, both you and Cui. I
forgive you both!</p>

<p>“I was nearly killed the other day. I went to Monaco sun-hunting and,
three days after in scrambling down the rocks, I fell head first on to
my face and bled so profusely that, for a long time, I was unable to get
up and go back to the hotel.</p>

<p>“However, as I had taken my place in the omnibus to Nice, I was bound to
get up and go back there next day.</p>

<p>“Hardly arrived there, I wished to see once more the terrace by the sea,
of which my recollection was so vivid. I went down and sat there but, in
changing my seat, again I fell on my face. Two passers-by lifted me with
great difficulty and took me to the Hotel des Etrangers, where I was
staying, which was close by. I was put to bed and there I stayed,
without a doctor, seeing no one but the servants for a week.</p>

<p>“Feeling a little better after my week’s seclusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_297" id="page_297">{297}</a></span> and damaged as I
was, I took the train back to Paris.</p>

<p>“My mother-in-law and servant exclaimed with horror on seeing me; but
now I have had a doctor and he has treated me so cleverly that, after
more than a month of it, I can barely walk, holding on to the furniture.</p>

<p>“My nose is nearly all right outside.</p>

<p>“Would you kindly find out why my score of the <i>Trojans</i> has not been
returned. I suppose the copying is finished and that it is no longer
needed.</p>

<p>“I can write no more ... if I wait till I am better it may be a long
while.... Do write to me. It will be a real charity.”</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<span class="smcap">Paris</span>, <i>26th May 1868</i>.&mdash;I have been greatly
tried and find it still hard to write. My two falls,
one at Monaco, the other at Nice, have taken all my
strength.</p>

<p>“The traces are almost gone now, but my old
trouble has come back and I suffer more than ever.</p>

<p>“I wish I could have seen you and Lecourt when
I was near Marseilles; I should have gone round
that way had I not been in such a sad state.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Stassoff</span>,&mdash;You see I leave out the <i>Monsieur</i>.</p>

<p>“I have just come from Grenoble, where they had almost forced me to
go and preside at a sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_298" id="page_298">{298}</a></span> musical festival and to be present at
the unveiling of a statue of Napoleon I.</p>

<p>“They ate and drank and did a hundred and fifty other things and I
felt so ill....</p>

<p>“They fetched me in a carriage and toasted me, but I could not
reply. The Mayor of Grenoble was full of compliments, he presented
me with a gilt crown, but I had to sit a whole hour at that
banquet.</p>

<p>“Next day I left and arrived home at eleven at night, more dead
than alive.</p>

<p>“I feel good for nothing and I get such letters&mdash;asking me to do
impossibilities. They want me to say nice things of a German
artist, which is right enough since I agree thoroughly, but at the
expense of a Russian artist of whom I think well also and whom they
want to oust in favour of the German.</p>

<p>“I cannot lend myself to it. What a devil of a world this is!</p>

<p>“I feel that I am dying; I believe in nothing; but I long to see
you, you might perhaps cheer me up&mdash;you and Cui. I am beyond
measure bored and weary. All my friends are away in the country or
shooting. They ask me to go and visit them, but I have not the
spirit.</p>

<p>“Write, I beg; as shortly as you will, but write! I still feel the
effects of my Monaco and Nice accidents.</p>

<p>“If you are in St Petersburg write me even <i>six lines</i>, I shall be
so grateful.</p>

<p>“You are so kind; show it now.</p>

<p>“I press your hands.”</p></div>

<p>Berlioz lived seven months longer.</p>

<p>On returning from Russia he consulted a physician who asked:</p>

<p>“Are you a philosopher?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_299" id="page_299">{299}</a></span></p>

<p>“Then gather all the courage you can from philosophy, for you are
incurable.”</p>

<p>He was evidently too worn and weak to take the Riviera journey alone.</p>

<p>Although warmly welcomed and cared for at his hotel, his two falls could
not but use up his little remaining strength, and that little was
cruelly drained by the last journey to Grenoble&mdash;a strangely weird and
dramatic episode, a worthy conclusion to his stormy, overcast life. The
scene is well described by M. Bernard:&mdash;</p>

<p>“In a brilliantly lighted hall, hung with magnificent draperies, at a
richly spread table a gay crowd awaits the chief guest of the evening.</p>

<p>“The curtains are torn aside, and a phantom appears. The ghost of
Banquo? No, the skeleton form of Berlioz, his face pale and thin, his
eyes vacant and wandering, his head trembling, his lips drawn in a
bitter smile.</p>

<p>“They crowd around him and press his hands&mdash;those palsied hands that
have so often led the armies of music to victory. A crown is placed upon
his silver locks.</p>

<p>“Vacantly he gazes round upon these fellow-citizens, gathered to do him
homage&mdash;sincere, but how belated!&mdash;mechanically he rises to reply to
words of which he has hardly grasped the meaning.</p>

<p>“Suddenly a furious Alpine gale dashes down into the hall, tearing at
the curtains, extinguishing the lights; outside the squall whistles
shrilly, the lightning cuts the blackness of the clouds, casting
sinister gleams on the faces of the dumb and startled assembly.</p>

<p>“Alone, amid the howls of the tempest, Berlioz stands, wrapped in
flashes of vivid green&mdash;the spirit of symphony&mdash;colossal musician, whose
apotheosis is heralded by Nature with her wildest, grandest music.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_300" id="page_300">{300}</a></span>”</p>

<p>That was the end.</p>

<p>On Monday morning, the 8th March 1869, Hector Berlioz died.</p>

<p>His funeral took place on the following Thursday at the Church of the
Trinity.</p>

<p>The Institute sent a deputation, the band of the National Guard played
selections from his <i>Funeral Symphony</i>; on the coffin lay wreaths from
the St Cecilia Society, from the youths of Hungary, from the Russian
nobles, and from the town of Grenoble.</p>

<p>He was dead&mdash;the atonement began.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_301" id="page_301">{301}</a></span></p>

even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
